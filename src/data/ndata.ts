    deskripsi:
      "Precise prediction of radar composite reflectivity (CREF) is essential in meteorology for monitoring and forecasting extreme weather events. Himawari-8 satellite imagery provides valuable data for this purpose, but the main challenge lies in effectively integrating multiple input channels from these satellite images to achieve precise prediction. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate and develop a U-Net model using visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) channels from Himawari-8 imagery for radar reflectivity prediction. The model was compared with Attention U-Net, which had been used in similar studies. The results showed that U-Net model with VIS channels performed better than other configurations. This model demonstrated lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models using IR channels. Despite the superior performance of VIS model, there are challenges in handling IR …",

    deskripsi:
      "Nowadays, most public facilities provide free internet access to support daily activities. These public internet facilities are open to anyone, making them prone to attacks. Communications between the host and router can become attack targets because they may contain important data traffic, such as credentials. Most of these public internet facilities still use Internet Protocol (IP) version 4 in their IP addressing, and attackers can use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) weaknesses as an opportunity. Man-in- the-Middle ARP (MitM-ARP) spoofing attacks can be launched to sniff credentials in host and router communication. We propose a comprehensive approach to solving the problem, which comprises two separate solution parts applied to the host and the router. In the host, we employ a combination of ping Round-Trip Time (RTT) anomaly detection, the SendARP function, static entry, and ping confirmation to detect …",

      "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are crucial for various real-life applications, from environmental and health monitoring systems to home and industrial automation. However, these networks face challenges in failure-prone environments, where sensor nodes must conserve energy while ensuring data reliability. We introduce FaultNet-Sim, a multithreaded simulator that facilitates the development of optimization strategies for balancing energy consumption and data reliability by tuning data transfer intervals in WSNs. The simulator can model different failure conditions and various time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based scheduling techniques, allowing users to analyze trade-offs between data loss and energy. With customizable parameters, FaultNet-Sim is a valuable tool for researchers looking to improve the resilience and efficiency of WSNs in real-world applications.",

      "Modeling temporal dynamics in recommendation systems is essential for capturing drifts in user preferences over time, particularly under conditions of data sparsity and non-stationarity. In this study, we propose a novel framework, Trust Decay-based Temporal Learning (TDTL), which integrates trust-region optimization, temporal regularization, and drift-aware adaptation to enhance the stability and adaptability of matrix factorization models. A key contribution of TDTL is the incorporation of bias-aware prediction and interaction-specific confidence weighting, which enables the model to capture rating tendencies and filter out noisy updates based on user-item frequency. TDTL also employs a BiGRU-based autoencoder to detect and refine temporal drift in user latent factors.

      "Graph neural networks (GNN) can learn powerful representations of graphs, but their effectiveness is heavily influenced by the quality of the graph structure used. Graph structure learning (GSL) was developed to find useful graph structures from data and learn better graph representations with GNN. GSL creates an adjacency matrix with two multilayer perceptrons and a biaffine attention network. However, it does not directly incorporate the principles of homophily, sparsity, and degree distribution, which are important in many real-life situations. Differentiable graph structure learning neural networks (DGSLN), which adhere to these basic principles, have been proven to improve GNN performance. This study proposes a GNN-based semantic dependency parsing model incorporating the GSL adapted from the DGSLN approach to generate an initial graph. For the graph representation learning stage, we use GNN …",

This paper addresses this challenge through three complementary contributions that systematically target SDCs from hardware manufacturing to application-level resilience. First, we analyze timing failures caused by random process variations in advanced technology nodes, revealing that extreme slow paths at lower voltages are dominated by single weak transistors—insights crucial for manufacturing and in-field testing. Second, we introduce an LLM-driven framework that generates targeted functional test programs to induce SDCs, demonstrating its effectiveness in stressing hardware, uncovering latent vulnerabilities, and increasing energy consumption in a given device under test (DUT), making it a valuable tool for in-field testing.

Besides, a highperformance facial emotion vision-based system requires an adaptive deep learning model with low parameter usage and computational cost. This work proposes a novel facial emotion recognizer in multi-resolution input (FERMOTION) with high performance and cost-efficiency. The proposed network offers a lightweight CNN approach that is improved from MobileNetV2, offering a large kernel receptive module and a pyramid enhancement module, each designed to improve effectiveness and efficiency. This approach introduces a new extractor module capable of discriminating facial emotion …",

      "Improving the Efficiency of a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Power Management System for HPC Clusters Using Curriculum Learning",
    deskripsi:
      "High energy consumption remains a key challenge in high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often feature hundreds or thousands of nodes drawing substantial power even in idle or standby modes. Although powering down unused nodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can degrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in particular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining optimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the performance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power management by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that introduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py simulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline DRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy …",

    deskripsi:
      "Weeds need to be removed from the immediate areas surrounding crops as they compete for soil nutrients. Farmers currently clear weeds manually, which is both tiring and imprecise. Therefore, researchers have developed artificial intelligence (AI) using deep learning or non-handcrafted methods to facilitate precise detection. However, these methods have yet to achieve real-time inference speeds. Consequently, this study adopts a handcrafted approach that employs visual leaf features for classification via ensemble learning. The objective is to employ feature selection and data normalization to create an accurate and efficient machine-learning model. The experimental findings obtained in this work demonstrate that Information Gain effectively reduces features by 50%, from 22 to 11, while maintaining accuracy. Chebyshev normalization emerges as the most suitable normalization technique, as it significantly enhances classification accuracy in ensemble learning. The accuracy obtained when using histogram gradient boosting is found to be 0.92 with an inference time of 5.955 ms per image. These outcomes illustrate that handcrafted features achieve higher accuracy than non-handcrafted methods, ultimately improving efficiency and enabling real-time implementation.

Then, the images are classified into age groups using an ordinal ranking neural network (ORNN) classifier. This classifier consists of a multiclass neural network binary classifier that categorizes the input images into different age groups.

The investigation compared pre-trained word embedding methods such as Word2vec, GloVe, FastText, and RoBERTa, as well as compared text encoding methods such as long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers. LSTMs are able to capture temporal semantics by employing state variables, while transformers are able to capture long-term dependency between parts of their input sequences. Additionally, we investigated classification-based and similarity-based training to build text encoders. We expected that these training approaches allowed encoders to extract different views of information. We compared classification results produced by different text encoders and combinations of text encoders. Result We evaluated various text representation approaches using the UKARA dataset. Our experiments showed that the FastText word embedding …",

    deskripsi:
      "Outliers can occur in application areas, adversely affecting the prediction method's performance. Outliers can be removed by using robust statistical algorithms. However, statistical methods have limitations in capturing the outlier for high-dimensional data. Approaches using Machine Learning (ML) are offered as they develop rapidly due to their excellent interpretability and strong generalization capabilities. So, ML is popular in detecting or eliminating outliers to increase the accuracy of forecasting methods, such as Isolation Forest (IF), an unsupervised outlier detection strategy using a collective approach to calculate the isolation score for every data point. This research objective is to improve the prediction accuracy of the Decision Tree Regression (DTR) method by proposing an IF as an ML-based outlier removal method.

      "This study proposes an end-to-end multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) approach to solve the biobjective traveling thief problems (TTP). A TTP involves a thief visiting cities and selecting items to maximize profit while minimizing travel time within a knapsack’s capacity. The study evaluates combinations of two architectures, namely the pointer network (PN) and attention mechanism (AM), with three MORL methods: deep reinforcement learning multiobjective algorithm (DRLMOA), multi-sample Pareto hypernetwork (PHN), and manifold-based policy search (MBPS). However, PN and AM cannot be directly used to predict two different sequences simultaneously: the city tour and the item selection. Therefore, a solution encoding and decoding scheme is proposed to solve TTP without substantially modifying PN and AM.

    deskripsi:
      "Aims The main aim of this research is to propose a new approach to financial time series data feature extraction using Moving Average Distance combined with Isolation Forest. Study Design Building a feature extraction using Moving Average Distance and Isolation Forest for time series data. Methodology We propose a Moving Average Distance to calculate the distance of the recent price to a moving average as input for the Isolation Forest algorithm. The distance measurement used in this research is measured in daily periods of 2,3,4,5,10, and 20. This period variation is used to observe the effect of different short, medium, and long terms on the forecasting accuracy. This moving average distance and isolation forest combination enrich the feature used as input for LSTM as a forecasting algorithm. Results The daily S&P 500 and SSE index are used as datasets to test the proposed method. The research results showed that the proposed method outperformed the accuracy of previous research. The 3-daily period of moving average distance was the best parameter for the model and gave the best accuracy performance measure for both datasets; we found that the more extended period than that tends to reduce the accuracy. Conclusion Our experimental results showed that the proposed method improves the ability of LSTM as a time series forecasting algorithm and outperforms the previous research results.",

      "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) typically consist of failure-prone sensor nodes and more reliable sink nodes. To prevent data loss, sensor nodes must regularly transfer their data to sink nodes. Therefore, setting an appropriate data transfer interval between them is crucial. This letter presents a method to optimize the data transfer interval using a Markov model. Although the Markov model directly implies the assumption of exponentially distributed failures' interarrival times, using extensive simulations, we showed that the optimal data transfer interval derived by this model still performs exceptionally well under other failure distributions with less than 7.3% difference in terms of period of data loss compared to the true optimal data transfer interval. We also discuss how to integrate the proposed method into the widely used communication protocol in WSN, TDMA, and show that it can improve data collection time and …",

    deskripsi:
      "Sign language (SL) is vital in fostering communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. Continuous Sign Language Translation (CSLT) is a work that translates sign language into spoken language. CSLT translation is done by changing continuous forms into isolated signs. Segmenting morpheme signs from phrase signs has several challenges, such as the availability of annotated datasets and the complexity of continuous gesture movements. The Indonesian Sign Language (SIBI) system follows Indonesian grammatical norms, including word formation, in contrast to other sign languages with rules derived from their spoken language. In SIBI, a word can consist of a root word and an affix word. Therefore, temporal action segmentation in SIBI is important to reconstruct the results of translating each sign into spoken Indonesian sentences. This research uses an optical flow approach to segment temporal actions in SIBI videos. Optical flow methods that calculate changes in intensity between adjacent frames can be used to determine the occurrence of sign movement or vice versa to determine the delay between sign movements. The absence of intensity differences between the two frames indicates the boundary between sign gestures. This study tested the use of dense optical flow on videos containing SIBI sentences taken from 3 signers. Evaluation is done on several parameters in the dense optical flow algorithm, such as threshold size, PyrScale, and WinSize, to obtain the best accuracy. This paper shows that the optical flow algorithm successfully performs segmentation, as measured by Perf and F1r. The experimental results …",

    deskripsi:
      "In this study, the detection and classification of seismic events is a significant concern of this research. A volcano eruption is one of the natural disasters on Earth. Monitoring volcano activities is essential to analyzing and monitoring volcanoes before their eruption. This activity is beneficial in interpreting signals from a volcano before an eruption from the volcano can cause damage. Based on that, a tool has been developed to detect and classify volcanic seismic events. The combination of algorithm time series, which is STA/LTA and machine learning (LSTM), is being used to analyze data of seismic events. A dataset was collected from one of Indonesia's mountains during 2019–2021. The dataset will be classified into different classes based on the type of seismic events. Noise detection is implemented to classify true or false seismic events before continuing to detect and classify them. STA/LTA is used to remove noise signals from data seismic events. The next step is to use machine learning to classify labelling signals based on the type of seismic events. The experiments use a learning rate of 0.001 and 0.01. They show that tools can detect and classify signals of seismic events with an accuracy of around 0, 70–0, 80.",

To address the shortcomings of the prior method, a neural network-driven strategy was introduced to differentiate between two types of skin lesions based on dermoscopic images. This new approach comprises four key stages: i) initial image processing, ii) skin lesion segmentation, iii) feature extraction, and iv) classification using deep neural networks (DNNs). Computers can also provide more accurate diagnosis results. In the review process, the articles are analyzed and summarized to contribute to developing methods or application development in skin lesion diagnosis. The stages include defining the relevant theory, input data, methods used (architecture and modules), training process, and model evaluation. This review also explores information based on trends and users, emphasizing the skin lesion segmentation process, skin lesion classification process, and minimal datasets as recommendations for future research.",

There are plenty of courses on those platforms, so the recommender system came up to help the user choose the one that matches their preferences. A recommender system with a collaborative filtering type is more suitable for non-formal education. Furthermore, a user might have some considerations for choosing a course. Therefore, we integrate side information into two collaborative filtering recommendation methods: Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The side information incorporated into BPR via feature augmentation, while we use the HybridSVD scheme for the SVD. We also tried to scale the rating matrix to promote the unpopular classes. The results show that the best top-N performance was achieved using the scaled HybridSVD with the course concept similarity matrix.",

      "As recorded on the Goodreads dataset, around 2 million books exist up until 2017. A recommendation system provides book recommendations based on user profiles. Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the methods of recommendation systems. There are several approaches, some of them are neighborhood-based, such as user-based CF and item-based CF. However, the computation is time-consuming, so clustering can be employed beforehand to create a faster model. The clustering will split users into several clusters and use CF to compute rating predictions. The results show that K-Means clustering reduces the inference time in both CF methods. Item-based CF is also found to be better suited to K-Means clustering than user-based CF.",

      "Integrating random forest model and internet of things-based sensor for smart poultry farm monitoring system",
    deskripsi:
      "The global poultry industry has encountered growing concerns related to foodborne illnesses, misuse of antibiotics, and environmental impacts. To tackle these issues, this study aims to develop an intelligent poultry farm with real-time environmental monitoring and predictive models. The primary objective is to combine a machine learning-based prediction model with internet of things (IoT) devices to gather and analyze environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, and ammonia levels, to forecast the conditions within poultry houses. These sensor data and additional information, such as feed consumption, water consumption, poultry weight, capacity, and poultry house dimensions will serve as inputs for supervised machine learning models. Among these models, the proposed random forest (RF) model, when augmented with timestamp features, achieves the highest accuracy rate of 96.665%, surpassing other models such as logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in identifying poultry house conditions. Additionally, this study demonstrates how the trained model can be effectively applied in a web-based monitoring system, delivering real-time data to farmers for well-informed decision-making and ultimately enhancing productivity in smart poultry farming.",

    deskripsi:
      "Non-formal education is possible to be obtained through online course platforms nowadays. Due to the vast number of courses in an online learning platform, a recommender system is needed as it helps to suggest a course that matches one’s preference. A collaborative filtering type of recommender system is more suitable for non-formal education. Besides that, a recommender system needs feedback to give suggestions, which often rely on explicit feedback. However, most publicly available datasets consist only of implicit feedback. Therefore, we employ two collaborative filtering recommendation methods that can utilize implicit feedback, namely Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) and Collaborative Less is More Filtering (CLiMF). A feature augmentation based on a content-based filtering technique is also performed to reduce the sparsity of the dataset. Using both MOOC Cube and Canvas Network datasets …",

      "Feature points obtained using traditional ORB methods often exhibit redundancy, uneven distribution, and lack scale invariance. This study enhances the traditional ORB algorithm by presenting an optimal technique for extracting feature points, thereby overcoming these challenges. Initially, the image is partitioned into several areas. The determination of the quantity of feature points to be extracted from each region takes into account both the overall number of feature points and the number of divisions that the image undergoes. This method tackles concerns related to the overlap and redundancy of feature points in the extraction process. To counteract the non-scale invariance issue in feature points obtained via the ORB method, a Gaussian pyramid is employed, and feature points are extracted at each level. Experimental findings demonstrate that our method successfully extracts feature points with greater …",

Incorporating time-dependent travel time into the problem formulation to model traffic congestion is critical, especially for problems with time-related costs, to decrease the difference in the projected quality of solutions when applying optimization methods in the real world. This study proposes a multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)-based method with hypernetwork and heterogeneous attention mechanism (HAM) with a two-stage training scheme to solve the bi-objective TDPDPLP. The proposed method can instantly generate an approximation of the Pareto optimal front (POF) after offline training.

    deskripsi:
      "Outliers can cause the results of the analysis to be biased. Two approaches to dealing with existing outliers are removing the outliers or modifying the method used. Commonly used methods like machine learning (ML) often require enhanced robustness in predicting outliers. One such method is decision tree regression (DTR). However, the DTR method has limitations as it does not consider outliers and makes predictions at leaf nodes based on central values of the data, which can introduce biases into the results. One of the algorithm that retains outliers is the M-estimator from robust regression. This study proposes a modification of the M-estimator for DTR by using Huber weights on leaf nodes for DTR predictions. We used five regression datasets sourced from UCI. The results are that the dataset with outliers provides better predictions on the concrete dataset, superconductivity dataset, Boston dataset, and Airfoil dataset having the best mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.963, 9.140, 2.021, and 1.644, with QSAR fish toxicity the only exception, where has the best MAE of 0.522 for the outlier remover dataset.",

    deskripsi:
      "Objective: This study aimed to characterize Amprotab that has been modified chemically, physically, and mechanically using HPMC and citric acid. Methods: The study is divided into two parts: three control formulas and three treatment formulas. Control Formula 1 (without HPMC and citric acid), Control 2 (HPMC 1.5 g without citric acids), Control 3 (citric acid 1.5 g without HPMC), Formula 1 (HPMC 4.5 g and citric acid 4.5 g). By analyzing Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), swelling, tensile strength, stability (freeze-thaw cycles), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), copolymers modified by Amprotab were characterized. Results: An FTIR analysis revealed that crosslinking of Amprotab was formed in formulas 1, 2, and 3 with prominent C= O ester bonds at peaks of 1730.22 cm-1, 1733.12 cm-1, and 1736.01 cm-1. The surface morphology of the modified cassava amylum CROSSLINKED COPOLYMER (CCA) was coarser. CCA's expanding power is less than that of natural Amprotab, whereas CCA's tensile strength is greater. Conclusion: CCA has a high value for syneresis. XRD analysis revealed that CCA has a crystal diffraction pattern of type B, and TGA analysis revealed that CCA is stable at high temperatures.",

      "Thresholding segmentation of skin lesions with modified ant colony optimization algorithm",
    deskripsi:
      "Image segmentation is the process of breaking up a digital image into many segments, each containing pixels with similar properties. Generally speaking, image segmentation aims to provide an easier-to-analyse and more understandable representation of a picture. Numerous techniques have been presented since this specific topic of picture segmentation was first introduced as a classical issue. The primary content of an image is broken down during the image segmentation process in order to make its representation simpler. Segmenting images involves the separation of pixels into different classes to enable analysis of objects within the image. Multithresholding is a commonly used method for segmentation, but the challenge lies in finding the optimal threshold that accurately segments each image. Metaheuristic methods are high-level procedures that aim to solve optimization problems by searching for acceptable solutions. Recently, researchers have become increasingly interested in using metaheuristics to address image segmentation as an optimization problem. By combining traditional approaches to image segmentation with metaheuristics, researchers have been able to enhance accuracy in various applications.",

    deskripsi:
      "Human action recognition plays a crucial role in intelligent monitoring systems, which are based on analyzing the possibility of anomalous events related to human behavior, such as theft, fights, and other incidents. However, by definition, anomalous events occur somewhat infrequently, thus leading to small and unbalanced data compared to data on other events. Such a data imbalance causes the human action recognition model to fail to produce optimal accuracy. To overcome the problem of imbalanced data, the typical methods used are oversampling and undersampling. However, these two methods are not considered to be very effective, because they cause the loss of a significant amount of information or deviations from reality. Therefore, the current paper proposes a cascade modeling strategy to address data imbalance problems, particularly in the case of human action recognition. The proposed strategy consists of several steps: preprocessing, feature extraction, modeling, and evaluation. The BAR dataset experiment found that the cascade model outperformed the other examined methods with an accuracy of 56.38%.

    deskripsi:
      "The underrepresentation of the Indonesian language in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be attributed to several key factors, including the absence of annotated datasets, limited language resources, and a lack of standardization in these resources. One notable linguistic phenomenon in Indonesia is code-mixing between Bahasa Indonesia and English, which is influenced by various sociolinguistic factors, including individual speaker characteristics, the linguistic environment, the societal status of languages, and everyday language usage. In an effort to address the challenges posed by code-mixed data, this research project has successfully created a code-mixed dataset for sentiment analysis. This dataset was constructed based on keywords derived from the sociolinguistic phenomenon observed among teenagers in South Jakarta. Utilizing this newly developed dataset, we conducted a series …",

      "Basketball is a very dynamic game where the movements the players make can be fast and subtle, yet fine-grained. As such the difference between an event occurring and not occurring can be small and occasionally unnoticeable, and the sequence of frames of which the dribble is done matters tremendously in order to determine whether a violation takes place. As such, a spatio-temporal action verification model is needed to assist referees in making decisions, as it is almost instantaneous in nature. The challenge is to achieve balance between speed and accuracy, since the violation detection has to be fast enough for real-time use. Mediapipe Pose Estimation is chosen for its lightweight nature and capability for human joint feature extraction, and YOLO is trained to detect and extract basketball coordinates and person in order to pinpoint a region of interest for Mediapipe Pose Estimation in the case of failure to …",

    deskripsi:
      "Time series forecasting using multilayer feed-forward neural networks (FNN) is potential to give high accuracy. Several factors influence the accuracy. One of them is the choice of activation functions (AFs). There are several AFs commonly used in FNN with their specific characteristics, such as bounded type AFs. They include sigmoid, softsign, arctan, and tanh. This paper investigates the effect of the amplitude in the bounded AFs on the FNNs’ accuracy. The theoretical investigations use simplified FNN models: linear equation and linear combination. The results show that the higher amplitudes give higher accuracy than typical amplitudes in softsign, arctan, and tanh AFs. However, in sigmoid AF, the amplitude changes do not influence the accuracy. These theoretical results are supported by experiments using the FNN model for time series prediction of 10 foreign exchanges from different continents compared to the US dollar. Based on the experiments, the optimum amplitude of the AFs should be high, that is greater or equal to 100 times of the maximum input values to the FNN, and the accuracy gains up to 3–10 times.",

    deskripsi:
      "Obfuscation is a technique for transforming program code into a different form that is more difficult to understand. Several obfuscation methods are used to obfuscate source code, including dead code insertion, code transposition, and string encryption. In this research, the development of an obfuscator that can work on C language source code uses the code transposition method, namely randomizing the arrangement of lines of code with a hash function and then using the DES encryption algorithm to hide the parameters of the hash function so that it is increasingly difficult to find the original format. This obfuscator is specifically used to maintain the security of source code in C language from plagiarism and piracy. In order to evaluate this obfuscator, nine respondents who understand the C programming language were asked to deobfuscate the obfuscated source code manually. Then the percentage of correctness and the average time needed to perform the manual deobfuscation are observed. The evaluation results show that the obfuscator effectively maintains security and complicates the source code analysis.",

    deskripsi:
      "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are widely used in solving classification problems. The biggest challenge of classification lies in the robustness of the ML algorithm in various dataset characteristics. Quadratic Interpolation Flower Pollination Neural Network (QIFPNN) is categorised into ML algorithm. The new QIFPNN's extraordinary capabilities are measured on binary-type datasets. This research ensures that the remarkable ability of QIFPNN also applies to non-binary datasets with balanced and unbalanced data class characteristics. Flower Pollination Neural Network (FPNN), Particle Swarm Optimisation Neural Network (PSONN), and Bat Neural Network (BANN) were used as comparisons. The QIFPNN, FPNN, PSONN, and BANN were used to train Multi-Layer-Perceptron (MLP). The test results on five datasets show that QIFPNN obtains an average classification accuracy higher than its comparison in three datasets with balanced and unbalanced data class characteristics. The three datasets are Iris, Wine, and Glass. The highest classification accuracy obtained by QIFPNN in the three datasets is 97.1462%, 98.6551%, and 73.1979%, respectively. Based on the F1-score test from QIFPNN, it is higher than all the comparisons in four datasets: Iris, Wine, Vertebral column, and Glass. Sequentially, 96.4599%, 98.7155%, 90.7517%, and 60.2843%. It proves that QIFPNN can also classify datasets with non-binary data types with balanced and unbalanced data class characteristics because they are more consistently tested on various datasets and are not susceptible to the influence of variations in dataset characteristics so that they can be …",

Pengamanan citra sidik jari dilakukan dengan cara dienkripsi kemudian disembunyikan dengan metode fraktal. Enkripsi dan dekripsi dilakukan dengan menggunakan citra himpunan Mandelbrot. Kemudian citra terenkrip disembunyikan menggunakan citra sampul berupa citra himpunan Julia. Proses enkripsi dilakukan dengan mengubah nilai bit ke-2 setiap piksel dari citra sidik jari kemudian ditambahkan nilai warna dari citra fraktalnya sehingga diperoleh citra terenkrip. Proses dekripsi adalah proses kebalikannya sehingga diperoleh citra sidik jari awal. Sedangkan proses penyembunyian citra terenkrip yang sudah dikonversi dalam bentuk matriks biner ke dalam citra sampul menggunakan manipulasi warna sehingga dihasilkan citra stego yang secara visual sama dengan citra sampulnya dan diharapkan tahan terhadap serangan. Digunakan 10 citra uji sidik jari dari situs Kaggle dan 5 citra fraktal Mandelbrot serta 5 citra himpunan Julia. Hasil analisis citra terenkripsi menghasilkan nilai NPCR adalah 100% dan nilai rerata UACI adalah 40, 99%. Hasil analisis citra stego menghasilkan rerata RMSE bernilai 0, 22 dan rerata PSNR bernilai 61,297 terhadap citra sampul. Waktu proses enkripsi dan dekripsi reratanya adalah 0, 14 detik, sedangkan waktu proses penyembunyian dan pengambilan citra reratanya adalah 4, 54 detik",

In some cases, very high accuracy represents an overfitting in the model, where a model adapts very well to the training data but poorly for the test or new data. Cross Validation (CV) strategies are often employed to reduce overfitting in a machine learning model. Several cross validation techniques have been developed recently as a part of machine learning workflow. However, the preference of choosing one cross validation method to another is still unclear in landslide susceptibility zoning. To illustrate this issue, the authors reproduce non CV, standard V-fold CV, and several spatial CV techniques using a benchmark dataset in Italy to train, validate and test an XgBoost model using 26 landslide controlling factors.

This paper introduces a novel strategy for detecting the loitering activities of humans in the monitoring area for an intelligent surveillance system based on a vision sensor. The proposed approach combines spatial and temporal information in the feature extraction stage to decide whether the human movement can be regarded as loitering. This movement has been previously tracked using human detectors and particle filter tracking. The proposed method has been evaluated using our dataset consisting of 20 videos. The experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve a relatively good accuracy of 85% when utilizing the random forest classifier in the decision stage. Thus, it could be integrated as one of the modules in an intelligent surveillance system.",

    deskripsi:
      "Contrast improvement and noise reduction are needed to improve aerial images prone to interference during data collection. Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is a histogram equalization (HE) development method that is commonly used for contrast improvement. Median blur (MB) is one of the methods used for noise reduction. Combining these two techniques helps optimize the preprocessing process before semantic segmentation analysis is carried out in image maps. The results of testing experiments with U-Net VGG-16 and VGG-19 on image maps show a detailed representation of the predicted pixel class. Comparing accuracy with state-of-theart methods shows that contrast enhancement and noise reduction are better than the previous method. The highest average result for combining CLAHE+ MB with U-Net VGG-16 was 76.5 and VGG-19 was 73.8, and the highest accuracy for image sample testing was 87.94 with U-net VGG-16.",

      "Brightness Perception in World-Centered Coordinates Assessed by Pupillometry",
    deskripsi:
      "Subjective brightness perception reportedly differs among the peripheral visual fields owing to lower- and higher-order cognition. However, there is still a lack of information associated with subjective brightness perception in the world-centered coordinates, not in the visual fields. In this study, we aimed to investigate the anisotropy of subjective brightness perception in the world-centered coordinates based on pupillary responses to the stimuli in five locations by manipulating the world-centered coordinates through active (requiring head movement) and passive scenes (without head movement) in a virtual reality environment. Specifically, this study aimed to elucidate if there is an ecological advantage in the five different locations in the world-centered coordinates. The pupillary responses to glare and halo stimuli indicated that the brightness perception differed among the five locations in the world-centered coordinates. Furthermore, we found that the pupillary response to stimuli at the top location might be influenced by ecological factors (such as from the bright sky and the sun’s existence). Thus, we have contributed to the understanding of the extraretinal information influence on subjective brightness perception in the world-centered coordinates, demonstrating that the pupillary response is independent of head movement.",

    deskripsi:
      "As one of the essential modules in intelligent surveillance systems, loitering detection plays an important role in reducing theft incidents by analyzing human behavior. This paper introduces a novel strategy for detecting the loitering activities of humans in the monitoring area for an intelligent surveillance system based on a vision sensor. The proposed approach combines spatial and temporal information in the feature extraction stage to decide whether the human movement can be regarded as loitering. This movement has been previously tracked using human detectors and particle filter tracking. The proposed method has been evaluated using our dataset consisting of 20 videos. The experimental results show that the proposed method could achieve a relatively good accuracy of 85% when utilizing the random forest classifier in the decision stage. Thus, it could be integrated as one of the modules in an intelligent surveillance system.",

Changes in trabecular bone due to osteoporosis can be observed on periapical radiographs, which are widely used in dental practice. This study proposes an automatic trabecular bone segmentation method for detecting osteoporosis using a color histogram and machine learning (ML), based on 120 regions of interest (ROI) on periapical radiographs, and divided into 60 training and 42 testing datasets. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on BMD as evaluated by dual X‐ray absorptiometry. The proposed method comprises five stages: the obtaining of ROI images, conversion to grayscale, color histogram segmentation, extraction of pixel distribution, and performance evaluation of the ML classifier.

One programming language that is widely used for machine learning applications and can accommodate the use of parallel processing is Python. Multiprocessing, mpi4py and CuPy are examples of Python libraries that can process data in parallel. In this research, we will compare the use of these libraries to process huge amounts of data. This research takes agricultural data for data image enhancement through color conversion from RGB to grayscale. The results showed that multiprocessing, mpi4py, and CuPy can increase the image enhancement speed three times faster than its singlecore execution. Then, using a combination of multiprocessing with CuPy, a 1.7 times performance improvement is achieved compared with multiprocessing-only. Also, using a combination of mpi4py with CuPy achieved 2.5 times performance improvement compared to mpi4py-only.",

    deskripsi:
      "Chili is a horticultural crop that has high economic value in Indonesia. The productivity level of chili in the country is not proportional to the level of consumption, one of the causes is malnutrition. Each plant requires different amounts of macronutrients and micronutrients to support plant growth and development. Chili plants that lack or excess macronutrients show different visual symptoms. Digital Image Processing is a non-destructive method that is useful for determining plant health conditions based on visual symptoms of chili leaves. The combination of digital image processing and learning methods such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM) helps classify the types of macronutrient deficiencies in order to obtain a nutrient solution. In this study, there are several stages in determining macronutrient deficiencies in chili plants, namely image acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, to classification using SVM with several kernels. Based on the experimental results in this study, the SVM method can help modern farmers to determine the health condition of plants non-destructively with 97.76% accuracy using a Polynomial kernel. Applying this system to an intelligent farming system is expected to support the realization of precision agriculture in Indonesia.",

Comparison of these methods is essential to determine the appropriate technique for improvement and further processing. This study applied and analyzed the HE, AHE, CLAHE, and GE methods in the grayscale and green channel malaria image and GCS, LCS, MGCS, and MLCS methods in color malaria images.

    deskripsi:
      "A primary concern when deploying a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system is its high energy consumption. Typical HPC systems consist of hundreds to thousands of compute nodes that consume huge amount of electrical power even during their idle states. One way to increase the energy efficiency is to apply the backfilling method to the First Come First Serve (FCFS) job scheduler (FCFS+Backfilling). The backfilling method allows jobs that arrive later than the first job in the queue to be executed earlier if the starting time of the first job is not affected, therefore increasing the throughput and the energy efficiency of the system. Nodes that are idle for a specific amount of time can also be switched off to further improve the energy efficiency. However, switching off nodes based only on their idle time can also impair the energy efficiency and the throughput instead of improving them. As an example, new jobs may …",

The machine learning method performs well in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems on network traffic. Recently, traditional machine learning processes network flow data without considering the network topology. Graph-based learning is capable of processing the topology of the data. An inductive Graph Neural Network is used to process large graphs. However, sampling is very challenging in aggregating relevant information from the neighborhood, which causes frequent noise. We propose the application of causal sampling to the Inductive Graph Neural Network model, E-GraphSAGE, to obtain relevant neighboring edges according to the causal weights.

Currently, most traffic control systems are still unable to capture traffic data, which means that traffic lights cannot be programmed to be adaptive. In this research paper, a traffic density estimation system based on Convolutional Neural Network was created. In order to do so, a video frame from a road surveillance camera was divided into several blocks. The CNN was then used to predict whether each of those blocks was occupied by vehicles. By doing so, the traffic density of each frame is able to be estimated. The result showed that the simplest CNN model, which only consisted of 27,074 weights and biases, achieved the accuracy of 97.47% and 96.57% towards training and validation data, respectively. The processing speed itself is decent since the system was able to run at approximately 15.52 frames per second.",

      "Fingerprint recognition is commonly used to verify a user’s identity. However, the fingerprint recognition systems in use today can be vulnerable to attacks. For example, some artificial fingerprints can spoof fingerprint recognition systems and use identity information to obtain personal information. For security reasons, fingerprint liveness detectors should be robust to attacks using various materials. As a result, we propose a fingerprint recognition method that uses multi-radius local binary pattern (Multi-radius LBP) and local phase quantization (LPQ) as local texture descriptors and wavelet transforms to remove noise. Classification results are obtained using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier. This study confirms that the proposed method is useful to improve the average fingerprint liveness detection tasks. On LivDet 2015 dataset, the proposed method achieves 6.73% Average Error Rate(AER).",

The standard malaria diagnosis is based on manual examination of a thick and thin blood smear, which heavily depends on the microscopist experience. This study proposed a system that can identify the life stages of plasmodium falciparum in human RBC. The image preprocessing process was done by illumination correction using gray world assumption, contrast enhancement using shadow correction, extraction of saturation component, and noise filtering. The segmentation process was applied using Otsu thresholding and morphological operation. The test results showed that the use of artificial neural network (ANN) using a combination of texture and morphological features gives better results when compared to the use of only texture or morphology features. The results showed that the proposed feature achieved an accuracy of 82.67%, a sensitivity of 82.18%, and a specificity of 94.17%, thus improving decision-making for malaria diagnosis.",

Emotion recognition is the best example of a layered problem where each emotion is attached to a sentiment. This research proposes an HNN model to solve the emotion recognition problem with three deep learning, one for the sentiment in the first layer and two models for the emotion prediction in the second layer. There are two combinations to be compared, full-LSTM and full-CNN. Surprisingly, the overall HNN performance for both combinations is similar, and both are below a control model without HNN architecture. However, solving the emotion recognition problems in the food security domain was still possible despite poor performance. The application result …",

    deskripsi:
      "Benchmarking results from experiments on research reactors showed that power reactors’ mathematical model produced conservative results in predicting the maximum cladding temperature on hot channels, with the mean difference showing overestimation. This overestimation is an accuracy issue arising from: the rigid demand and requirement for highly specialized expertise needed for input preparation of large and complex mathematical models in a computer program, the simplification and assumptions when translating physical phenomena into mathematical models, the complexity of the cooling regime, and the specific characteristics of research reactors. This paper aims to overcome the accuracy issue using a hybrid method that combines mathematical models, machine learning, and experimental results. Machine learning compensates for the bias between experimental results and mathematical models …",

      "Acne Classification with Gaussian Mixture Model based on Texture Features",
    deskripsi:
      "This paper presents an acne detection method on face images using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). First, the skin area in the face image is segmented based on color information using the GMM. Second, the candidates of the acne region are then extracted using a Laplacian of Gaussian-based blob detection strategy. Then, texture features are extracted from acne candidates using either a Gabor Filter or Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). Lastly, these features are then utilized as input in the GMM for verifying whether these regions are acne or not. In our experiment, the proposed method was evaluated using face images from ACNE04 dataset. Based on the experiment, it is found that the best classification results were obtained when GLCM features in the Cr-YCbCr channel are applied. In addition, the proposed method has competitive performance compared to K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN).",

    deskripsi:
      "An experimental investigation on the thermohydraulic parameters of the Kartini research reactor by varying the primary pump flow has been conducted to study the behavior of fuel and coolant temperatures and heat transfer. The variation of the primary pump flow was physically simulated by gradually reducing the pump rotation while keeping the reactor power at maximum. An experimental tool equipped with seven thermocouple sensors and a Data Acquisition System was inserted into the hottest channel of the reactor core to obtain accurate data of the coolant temperature in the reactor core. This paper presents detailed results and analysis of the investigation. The main result is a unique pattern arising from the fuel and coolant temperature data, which allows us to identify three stages: flow-dominated, chaotic or transition, and natural circulation stages.

    deskripsi:
      "Illegal parking is a violation that often occurs in urban areas. Supervision is conducted in places where parking is prohibited to overcome this problem. Manual monitoring requires high staff performance and costs. Therefore, a video-based illegal parking detection is proposed. Previous studies have several weaknesses in videobased illegal parking detection, especially those that use background modeling techniques. Examples of drawbacks include changes in illumination and imperfect segmentation caused by noise, leading to false-positive errors. This study aims to overcome the problem of frequently occurring false-positive errors by using the improved visual background extractor (I-ViBe). This method develops the ViBe approach to detect illegal parking by modifying the background model update mechanism with the static region extraction and vehicle verification processes and integrating tracking processes. Experimental results show that the values of precision, recall, and f-measure are 100%, 60%, and 75% respectively, which means that the proposed system has overcome all false-positive problems.",

    deskripsi:
      "As part of the early warning system, forest fire detection has a critical role in detecting fire in a forest area to prevent damage to forest ecosystems. In this case, the speed of the detection process is the most critical factor to support a fast response by the authorities. Thus, this article proposes a new framework for fire detection based on combining color-motion-shape features with machine learning technology. The characteristics of the fire are not only red but also from their irregular shape and movement that tends to be constant at specific locations. These characteristics are represented by color probabilities in the segmentation stage, color histograms in the classification stage, and image moments in the verification stage. A frame-based evaluation and an intersection over union (IoU) ratio was applied to evaluate the proposed framework. Frame-based evaluation measures the performance in detecting fires. In contrast, the IoU ratio measures the performance in localizing the fires. The experiment found that the proposed framework produced 89.97% and 10.03% in the true-positive rate and the false-negative rate, respectively, using the VisiFire dataset. Meanwhile, the proposed method can obtain an average of 21.70 FPS in processing time. These results proved that the proposed method is fast in the detection process and can maintain performance accuracy. Thus, the proposed method is suitable and reliable for integrating into the early warning system.",

    deskripsi:
      "Many world phenomena lead to nonlinear equations systems. For some applications, the non-linear equations which construct the non-linear equations system are interpolation functions. However, the interpolation functions are usually not represented as mathematical expressions but as computer programs in specific programming languages. The research proposed using the relaxed Newton method to solve the non-linear equations system that contained interpolation functions. The interpolation functions were represented in the R programming language. Then, the experiment used the Spline interpolation function to construct a two-dimensional non-linear equations system. Eleven initial guesses, maximum of ten-time iterations, and 10-7 precision were applied. The solution of the non-linear equations system and the iteration needed on each initial guess were observed. The experiment shows that the proposed method works well for solving the non-linear equations system constructed by Spline interpolation functions. By observing the initial guesses used in the experiment, there are four possible results: true solution, spurious solution, false solution, and no solution. Applying 11 initial guesses have five initial guesses resulting in true solutions, one initial guess in spurious solution, three initial guesses in false solutions, and one initial guess in no solution. The discussions imply that this method can be generalized to the three-dimensional non-linear equations system or higher dimensions.",

    deskripsi:
      "Nutrient contents are important for plants. Lack of macronutrients causes plant damage. Several macronutrient deficiencies exhibit similar visual characteristics that are difficult for ordinary farmers to identify. Collaboration between Computer Vision technology and IoT has become a nondestructive method for nutrient monitoring and control, included in the hydroponic system. Computer vision plays a role in processing plant image data based on specific characteristics. However, the analysis of one characteristic cannot represent plant health. In addition, knowing the percentage of macronutrient deficiencies is also needed to support precision agriculture systems. Therefore, we propose a Multi Layer Perceptron architecture that can perform multi-tasks, namely, identification and estimation. In addition, the optimal architecture will also be sought based on the characteristics of the combination of three features in the form of texture, color, and leaf shape. Based on analysis and design, our proposed model has a high potential for identifying and estimating macronutrient deficiency at the same time as well and can be applied to support precision agriculture in Indonesia.",

Several methods were applied to determine the intervals, but the performances are still not optimal. This paper proposes a new approach that uses a combination of Absolute Differences and K-means Clustering in the Fuzzy Time Series Markov Chain model. K-means Clustering made the interval more flexible and compact based on the data it clustered. In addition, Absolute Differences was used as the based method to define how many intervals to be made. This study used Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) as benchmark data to evaluate the proposed method, which produced an average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 0.42, and an average Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value of 51.09 for the test data.

    deskripsi:
      "Currently, research for osteoporosis examination using dental radiographic images is increasing rapidly. Many researchers have used various methods from subject data. It indicates that osteoporosis has become a widespread disease that should be studied more deeply. This study proposes a deep Convolutional Neural Network architecture as a texture feature of dental periapical radiograph for osteoporosis detection. The subject of this study is postmenopausal Javanese women aged over 40 and data measurement result of Bone Mineral Density. The proposed model is divided into stages: 1) stage image acquisition and RoI selection, 2) stage feature extraction and classification. Various experiments with the number of convolution layers (3 layers to 6 layers) and various input block sizes and other hyper parameters were used to get the best model. The best model is obtained when the input image size is greater than 100 and less than 150 and a five of convolution layer, as well as other hyper parameters, including epochs= 100, dropout= 0.5, learning rate= 0.0001, batch size= 16 and loss function using Adam's optimization. Validation and testing accuracy achieved by the best model is 98.10%, and 92.50. The research shows that the bigger images provide additional information about trabecular patterns in normal, osteopenia and osteoporosis classes, so that the proposed method using deep convolutional neural network as textural feature of the periapical radiograph achieves a good performance for detection osteoporosis.",

A random stimulus was presented in a few seconds, and another few seconds, as feedback, observers reported the stimulus was perceived as the moon or the sun. To overcome the lack of previous studies that have not been able to segregate the physical (Glare effect) and cognition factors of image stimulus, the data were grouped into two categories, ie, as the actual image (the ground truth,“GT”) and observers’ perception (“PR”) responses. As a result, the pupil constricted significantly when the stimulus is perceived as the sun. Furthermore, this pupillary response is unassociated with the average physical luminance of images. This result indicates that highlevel cognition influences perception pupillary response.",

    deskripsi:
      "This paper addresses issues facing eGovernment in Libya in particular. Based on defined set of criteria, eGovernment can be completely identified. For enormous period in developing countries, eGovernment has been introduced. However, in many countries, including Libya, eGovernment services continue to face numerous challenges in their implementation and widespread adoption. From previous research, eGovernment implementation was noted as major challenge for Libyan authorities, given potential issues posed by their residents. However, literature review and discussion show essential factors that influence people’s intention to implement eGovernment services in Libya. It has been distributing 164 questionnaires for Libyan government citizens. As result, determination and classification of these factors have been carried out through exploratory study to investigate significance of these factors. This research has therefore established factors that decide whether citizen is adopting eGovernment services and thereby help governments gain access to adoptions they need or other factors that need to be established.",

      "High-Utility Association Rules Mining Based-on Binary Particle Swarm Optimization",
    deskripsi:
      "Traditional association rule mining algorithm only generates a set of rules from frequent itemset, the rules obtained cannot generate rules from high-utility itemset. This is because the framework that’s being used to obtain rules from traditional association rule is support-confidence while getting high-utility itemset association rules uses the utility-confidence framework. The model for high-utility association rule mining proposed is using particle swarm optimization. The fitness function to get high-utility association rules does not use support-confidence but uses the utility-confidence framework. The association rule mining model of high-utility itemset does not look for high-utility itemset first but together with the high-utility itemset mining process. The high-utility association rule mining using the particle swarm optimization approach has better rule set quality than using the traditional approach, Apriori. Testing with five datasets: chess, connect, mushroom, accident, and foodmart, shows the average utility-confidence obtained using our proposed method is above 88%.",

    deskripsi:
      "Face detection is the main component in the development of CCTV-based Intelligent Surveillance System. Face Detection is used to identify a person when a suspicious event occurs. Therefore, the face detection module must be reliable and fast in analyzing every frame produced by CCTV. RetinaFace is a deep learning-based face detection method that produces very high accuracy. However, RetinaFace cannot be fully implemented directly on the ISS due to limitations in detecting faces in environments with illumination changes. Thus, in this paper, we propose to utilize the detection-based tracking to improve the detection results of RetinaFace as post-processing stages. The tracking system successfully increases the recall score of the detection of faces on recordings with 25 FPS by 4.47%.",

    deskripsi:
      "Twitter is a massive source of information that can potentially be used to obtain valuable insights about public opinions, public ideas, and public circumstances. Extracting accurate information from tweets, however, is often challenging due to the use of informal, non-standard, and figurative languages including sarcasm. Sarcasm itself conveys messages using words with opposite literal meaning. Sarcasm detection, therefore, becomes an important task during information extraction from public tweets. This research proposes the use of LSTMs to detect sarcastic tweets in Indonesian language through the extraction of sentence-embedding features. LSTMs have been known to be able to learn sequential patterns in input data so that features extracted by LSTMs are more representative than those manually hand-crafted by human. The proposed LSTMs are combined with the Word2Vec model that serves as a word …",

      "Improvement of Deep Learning-based Human Detection using Dynamic Thresholding for Intelligent Surveillance System",
    deskripsi:
      "Human detection plays an important role in many applications of the intelligent surveillance system (ISS), such as person re-identification, human tracking, people counting, etc. On the other hand, the use of deep learning in human detection has provided excellent accuracy. Unfortunately, the deep-learning method is sometimes unable to detect objects that are too far from the camera. It is because the threshold selection for confidence value is statically determined at the decision stage. This paper proposes a new strategy for using dynamic thresholding based on geometry in the images. The proposed method is evaluated using the dataset we created. The experiment found that the use of dynamic thresholding provides an increase in F-measure of 0.11 while reducing false positives by 0.18. This shows that the proposed strategy effectively detects human objects, which is applied to the ISS.",

      "Modified Flower Pollination Algorithm for Disease Identification in Swine",
    deskripsi:
      "Pigs have become an essential part of the cultural and economic life of the people in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) Province. Diseases in pigs significantly affect the success of pig farming. Identification of disease in pigs is a classification problem. Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used in Neural Network (NN) optimization to solve classification problems. Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is grouped into a metaheuristic algorithm that has been commonly used in optimization cases in the real world. To improve FPA performance, this study proposes replacing the FPA step vector parameter, namely Levy distribution, with Newton Polynomial Quadratic Interpolation (NPQI), known as Quadratic Interpolation Flower Pollination (QIFP). Quadratic Interpolation Flower Pollination Neural Network (QIFPNN), Flower Pollination Neural Network (FPNN), Bat Neural Network (BANN), and Particle Swarm Optimization Neural Network (PSONN) algorithms were used to train NN in real cases of disease identification in pigs, covering 11 diseases with 68 clinical symptoms. The results showed that the proposed algorithm, namely QIFPNN, outperformed FPNN, BANN, and PSONN in classification accuracy. QIFPNN is also able to improve classification accuracy and speed of convergence when compared to FPNN. QIFPNN and FPNN, respectively, provide 82.6159% and 67.4766% accuracy, and the training time is 6056.240 seconds and 6555.179 seconds. QIFPNN accuracy increased by 22.40%, and training time was 7.61% faster. It concluded that QIFPNN could be used as a complementary model in disease identification in pigs.",

Re-ID visually matching one person or group in various situations obtained from different cameras or on the same camera but at different times. This method replaces the task of surveillance through surveillance cameras that was previously carried out conventionally by humans because it is prone to errors. The challenge of Re-ID is the pose of varied objects, occlusions, and the appearance of people who tend to be similar. Occlusion issues receive special attention since the performance of Re-ID can decrease due to partial occlusion. This can occur because the re-identification process relies on features of the person such as the color and pattern of clothing.

The encryption process is carried out by changing each pixel of the plain image, that is changing the bit value of the 2nd bit (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) then adding the color value of the fractal image to obtain an encrypted image. While the decryption process is the reverse process, ie each pixel of the encrypted image its color value minus the color value of the fractal image then the 2nd bit value is changed (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) so that the decrypted image is the same as the original image. Then, a computer program was created that was able to encrypt and decrypt color images using Mandelbrot set images, both single fractal and multi fractal, and then analyzed the results of the program. The encrypted images from 6 test images were analyzed by determining the NPCR and UACI values, where the NPCR values were all 100% while the average UACI value was 31.47%. The average encryption time is 2.95 seconds and the average decryption time is 2.89 seconds. The decrypted image has RMSE= 0 to the original image, this shows that the decrypted image is exactly the same as the plain image and from the UACI value of some test data and also based on visual observations show that the encrypted image using multi fractals is slightly better compared to a single fractal.",

      "Improving the Efficiency in Multiple Object Tracking by Tracker Switching According to Occlusion States",
    deskripsi:
      "The objective of multiple object tracking (MOT) is to locate the positions of multiple objects in a video, maintain their identities, and obtain their individual trajectories. One of the most crucial challenges of MOT is how to handle object occlusion effectively. The existing methods try to treat different occlusion situations with the same architecture, which leads to limits on performance. More specifically some trackers can achieve fast speed (frame per second) but cannot handle occlusion effectively, while other trackers can handle occlusion properly but are expensive due to costly computational resources. The proposed method estimates the occlusion states of objects, applies different trackers according to the estimation results, and finally combines the results of different trackers. This method can reduce unnecessary computational costs, and consequently can improve the efficiency of the high accuracy trackers. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal for different scenarios.",

    deskripsi:
      "The pre-processing and feature extraction stages are the primary stages in object searching on video data. Processing video in all frames is inefficient. Frames that have the same information should only be once processed to the next stage. Then, the feature extraction algorithm that is often used to process video frames is SIFT and SURF. The SIFT algorithm is very accurate but slow. On the other hand, the SURF algorithm is fast but less accurate. Therefore, the requirement for keyframe selection and feature extraction methods is fast and accurate in object searching on real-time video. Video is pre-processed by extracting video into frames. Then, the mutual information entropy method is used for keyframe selection. Keyframes are extracted using the ORB algorithm. The multiple object detection in the video is done by clustering on features. The feature extraction results on each cluster are matched with the results …",

      "Traditional Javanese compositions contain melodies and skeletal melodies. Skeletal melodies are an extraction form of melodies. The melody extraction problem is similar to the chord detection in Western music, where chords are extracted from a melody. This research aims to develop a melody extraction system for traditional Javanese compositions. Melodies which have a time series data structure were designed as a part of the supervised learning problem to be solved using the pattern recognition technique and the Feed-Forward Neural Networks method. The melody data source uses a symbolic format in the form of sheet music. The beats in melodies data are used as the input and notes in skeletal melodies are used as the target. An FFNN multi-class classifier was built with six classes as the targets, where the class represents notes of the musical scale system. The network evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F-1 score measurements.",

    deskripsi:
      "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an algorithm that can classify image data with very high accuracy but requires a long training time so that the required resources are quite large. One of the causes of the long training time is the existence of a backpropagation-based classification layer, which uses a slow gradient-based algorithm to perform learning, and all parameters on the network are determined iteratively. This paper proposes a combination of CNN and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to overcome these problems. Combination process is carried out using a convolution extraction layer on CNN, which then combines it with the classification layer using the ELM method. ELM method is Single Hidden Layer Feedforward Neural Networks (SLFNs) which was created to overcome traditional CNN’s weaknesses, especially in terms of training speed of feedforward neural networks.

    deskripsi:
      "A public database containing representative data of karawitan traditional music is needed as a resource for researchers who study computer music and karawitan. To establish this database, a text-based pitch model for music representation that is both human and computer-based was first investigated. A new model of musical representation that can be read by humans and computers is proposed to support music and computer research on karawitan also known as gamelan music. The model is expected to serve as the initial effort to establish a public database of karawitan music representation data. The proposed model was inspired by Helmholtz Notation and Scientific Pitch Notation and well-established, text-based pitch representation systems. The model was developed not only for pitch number, high or low or middle pitch information (octave information), but for musical elements found in gamelan sheet music pieces that include pitch value and legato signs. The model was named Gendhing Scientific Pitch Notation (GSPN). Ghending is a Javanese word that means “song”. The GSPN model was designed to represent music by formulating musical elements from a sheet music piece. Furthermore, the model can automatically be converted to other music representation formats. In the experiment, data in the GSPN format was implemented to automatically convert sheet music to a binary code with localist representation technique.",

Based on the cognitive level, it appears that the C1 level is the lowest thinking level while C6 is the highest thinking level. However, cognitive classification to develop students' knowledge towards high-level cognitive skills has not been applied to managing students in learning. The focus of this study is to determine the cognitive classification structure using the bloom taxonomy. Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) is used to classify cognitive levels into three classes, namely Low Cognitive (CL), Medium Cognitive (CM), and High Cognitive (CH).

    deskripsi:
      "The smart city concept development, particularly in smart parking systems, has not solved a problem in metropolitan or urban areas. In those areas, the population continues to rise, resulting in high demand for private vehicles and parking spaces. Finding a parking space is the most common issue a driver encounters, especially during peak hours. During peak hours, the difficulty arises as many people look around to find vacant parking spaces at once, which causes many negative impacts on cities and drivers themselves, such as pollution, traffic congestion, traffic accidents, waste of time and fuel, emotions, and so on. As a solution, a smart parking system exists to equip parking lots with many different sensors to automatically detect free parking spaces that would guide drivers to find the nearest parking space as efficiently as possible. An effective smart parking system can solve this problem and make better use of parking resources. However, many smart parking systems still use embedded sensors that are expensive for installation and inefficient. This paper presents a review of the existing approaches to the smart parking system. This paper focuses on machine-vision-based technology used for smart parking systems and highlights its main features, advantages, and disadvantages.",

Existing methods of Customer Activity Recognition (CAR) recognize CA by specialized end-to-end (e2e) models. Consequently, when marketing requires changing recognition targets, specialized e2e models are not reconfigurable to fit different marketing demands unless rebuilding the models entirely. Besides, redundant computation in the existing CAR system leads to low efficiency. Also, the low maintainability of the CAR system results in lots of modifications when updating methods in the system. In this research, we decompose behaviors into several primitive units called “event”.

      "Inflation occurs where there is an increase in the price of goods or services in general and continuously in a country. Uncontrolled inflation will have an impact on the decline of the Indonesian economy. Therefore, the prediction of future inflation levels is necessary for the government to develop economic policies in the future. Prediction of inflation levels can be done by studying historical past Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. Regression methods are often used to solve prediction problems. The problem of finding the optimal prediction model can be seen as an optimization problem. Genetic algorithms are often used to deal with optimization problems. Thus, this work proposed to use a genetic algorithm-based regression model for predicting inflation levels. The model was trained and evaluated using real CPI data which obtained from the Indonesian Central Bank. Based on the experiment, it is proved that the proposed model is effective in predicting the inflation level as it gains MSE of 0.1099.",

    deskripsi:
      "This paper presents a novel approach to accelerate applications running on integrated CPU-GPU systems. Many integrated CPU-GPU systems use cache-coherent shared memory to communicate. For example, after CPU produces data for GPU, the GPU may pull the data into its cache when it accesses the data. In such a pull-based approach, data resides in a shared cache until the GPU accesses it, resulting in long load latency on a first GPU access to a cache line. In this work, we propose a new, push-based, coherence mechanism that explicitly exploits the CPU and GPU producer-consumer relationship by automatically moving data from CPU to GPU last-level cache. The proposed mechanism results in a dramatic reduction of the GPU L2 cache miss rate in general, and a consequent increase in overall performance.

    deskripsi:
      "Mapping MPI processes to processor cores, called process mapping, is crucial to achieving the scalable performance on multi-core processors. By analyzing the communication behavior among MPI processes, process mapping can improve the communication locality, and thus reduce the overall communication cost. However, on modern non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, the memory congestion problem could degrade performance more severely than the locality problem because heavy congestion on shared caches and memory controllers could cause long latencies. Most of the existing work focus only on improving the locality or rely on offline profiling to analyze the communication behavior.",

    deskripsi:
      "Many Javanese manuscripts in Indonesia are stored in museums and libraries. Most of these manuscripts were written using local scripts that are rarely used in everyday life, and hence a software application that can help and improve the reading of these manuscripts is valuable. An essential step in automatic manuscript image transliteration is post-processing, which involves editing and concatenating syllables into words. The main problem of post-processing is that there exists no symbol for space between words in a sentence, which is called the scriptio-continua problem. This paper proposes methods based on the backtracking algorithm to solve the scriptio continua in the post-processing step of Javanese manuscript image transliteration. The proposed methods use a depth-first search in seeking relevant candidate words to determine whether to merge a new syllable or not. The results of the proposed …",

    deskripsi:
      "High-utility itemset mining is used to obtain high utility itemsets by taking into account both the quantity as well as the utility of each item, which have not been considered in frequent itemset mining. Many algorithms compute high utility itemsets by setting a minimum utility threshold in advance. However, determining the minimum utility threshold is not easy. Too high or too low a threshold may result in incorrect high utility itemsets. In this paper, we propose a method based on binary particle swarm optimization to optimize the search for high utility itemsets without setting the minimum utility threshold beforehand. Instead, the application of the minimum utility threshold is performed as a post-processing step. Experiments on five datasets indicate that the proposed method is better than existing methods in finding high utility itemsets, and the time to obtain those itemsets is faster than that with setting the minimum utility …",

Classification of vehicle density levels on certain roads is required because there are at least 7 vehicle density level conditions. Monitoring conducted by the police, the Department of Transportation and the organizers of the road currently using video-based surveillance such as CCTV that is still monitored by people manually. Deep Learning is an approach of synthetic neural network-based learning machines that are actively developed and researched lately because it has succeeded in delivering good results in solving various soft-computing problems, This research uses the convolutional neural network architecture. This research tries to change the supporting parameters on the convolutional neural network to further calibrate the maximum accuracy. After the experiment changed the parameters, the classification model was tested using K-fold cross-validation, confusion matrix and model exam with data testing. On the K-fold cross-validation test with an average yield of 92.83% with a value of K (fold)= 5, model testing is done by entering data testing amounting to 100 data, the model can predict or classify correctly ie 81 data.",

      "Chicken is an animal that can provide many benefits for human life, meat and eggs can be used as food to fulfill the needs of human food, the excrement can be made fertilizer, and frequently its be used as a farm animal. Although it can provide many benefits, but for chicken farmers, the maintenance of chicken meet some obstacles that must be faced such as disease, poor environmental sanitation, and the production of eggs are declining. From some of the obstacles that have been mentioned, the most frequently encountered are animals infected with the disease. Based on the results of interviews that have been done to some chicken farmers, it can be said that the knowledge of chicken farmers against chicken disease and its handling is still very lacking. But the number of experts who understand and know about the type of chicken disease and the way of handling is limited, then it takes an expert system that can simulate knowledge and understanding of experts to overcome the problem. Based on the study of the libraries, the method suitable for use in the expert system is the Dempster shafer method by processing the value of belief in a disease. Dempster shafer method is a method used to calculate uncertainty due to the addition or reduction of new facts that will change the existing rules. Based on tests in 40 cases using an expert system applying the Dempster Shafer method, obtained the percentage of diagnostic compatibility result given by experts and system is 95%.",

    deskripsi:
      "Usability evaluation focuses on how well users can learn and use products to achieve their goals. Evaluation of e-commerce website usability can be done using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method. Usability is considered a multi-criteria problem due to its complex structure. Logarithmic Fuzzy Preference Programming (LFPP), a non-linear programming approach, is one of the FAHP methods for weighting criteria. However, deficiencies in the LFPP method, in some cases, result in a consistency value of 0 from a consistent fuzzy comparison matrix, which should be greater than 0. This study modifies the LFPP method with the Modified LFPP (MLFPP) models. Modifications were made as a development of the LFPP method in improving the accuracy of the consistency index (𝜆∗) before weighting criteria. The MLFPP makes improvements to the functional constraints, while at the same time improving the determination of criteria weights. The MLFPP model uses arctan to limit functions to improve consistency index. The test results show that the MLFPP can improve the accuracy of the consistency index values in the pairwise comparison matrix given by experts to be more than 0, with an average increase of 14.9%. The amount of consistency index (𝜆∗) changes has improved the usability score by 6.59%.",

      "One of the main stages in object searching on video is extracting object regions from video. Template matching is popular technique for performing a such task. However, the use of template matching has a limitation that requires a large object as a template. If the template size is too small, it would obtain few features. On the other hand, ORB descriptors are often used for representing the object with a good accuracy and fast processing time. Therefore, this research proposed to use machine learning method combining with ORB descriptor for object searching on video data. Processing video in all frames is inefficient. Thus, frames are selected into keyframes using mutual information entropy. The ORB descriptors are then extracted from selected frame in order to find candidate region of objects. To verify and classify the object regions, multiclass support vector machine was used to train ORB descriptor of regions …",

In this research, the image of Julia's set of the complex functions z2-c are used, with utilizing the properties of fractals, which are sensitive to initial value, self-similarity and iterative. First, it discussed how to hide the secret image in a cover image, the image of the Julia set of the complex function z2-c with the value c being one of the components of the key and also using color manipulation (RGB) of the cover image, the secret image that has been converted in the form of a binary matrix 0, 1 can be hidden so as to produce a stego image which is visually the same as the cover image and is expected to be resistant to attacks. Then, the computer program is created that is able to hide and retrieve the secret image in the cover image of Julia set. From the analysis of the results of the computer program, the comparison between the cover image and the stego image with 512x512 pixels, it is found that the average of RMSE is 0.2305 and the average of PSNR is 60.88 db from 12 data sets, this shows that the two images are very similar so that it is difficult to distinguish which image contains a secret image with the largest secret image size of 128x85 pixels or 261,120 bits. The average time for hiding the secret image is 1.626 seconds (not including the time for making the cover image), while the time for retrieving the secret image is 4.526 seconds on average.",

    deskripsi:
      "One of the problems in the promotion is the high cost. Identifying the customer segments that have made transactions, sellers can promote better products to potential consumers. The segmentation of potential consumers can be integrated with the products that consumers tend to buy. The relationship can be found using pattern analysis using the Association Rule Mining (ARM) method. ARM will generate rule patterns from the old transaction data, and the rules can be used for recommendations. This study uses a segmented-based sequential rule method that generates sequential rules from each customer segment to become product promotion for potential consumers. The method was tested by comparing product promotions based on rules and product promotions without based on rules. Based on the test results, the average percentage of transaction from product promotion based on rules is 2,622%, higher than the promotion with the latest products with an average rate of transactions only 0,315%. The hypothesis in each segment obtained from the sample can support the statement that product promotion in all segments based on rules can be more effective in increasing sales compared to promotions that use the latest products without using rules recommendations.",

    judul: "Improving learning vector quantization using data reduction",
    deskripsi:
      "Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) is a supervised learning algorithm commonly used for statistical classification and pattern recognition. The competitive layer in LVQ studies the input vectors and classifies them into the correct classes. The amount of data involved in the learning process can be reduced by using data reduction methods. In this paper, we propose a data reduction method that uses geometrical proximity of the data. The basic idea is to drop sets of data that have many similarities and keep one representation for each set. By certain adjustments, the data reduction methods can decrease the amount of data involved in the learning process while still maintain the existing accuracy. The amount of data involved in the learning process can be reduced down to 33.22% for the abalone dataset and 55.02% for the bank marketing dataset, respectively.",

    deskripsi:
      "The C4. 5 algorithm is a widely used classification method in recommendation system as it has several advantages. However, it also has several disadvantages, such as 1) the finding of nodes with zero values or nearly zero value that does not contribute in generating rules 2) too many nodes are formed so that the tree generated is too large. The weaknesses of the C4. 5 algorithm need an improvement so that the algorithm can run well with the existing case. This article proposes an improvement to the C4. 5 algorithm by using L’Hospital Rule and prunning (C4. 5 LHP algorithm). Based on the experiments conducted using eight datasets, the result shows that the improved C4. 5 LHP algorithm has a higher level of accuracy (about 1, 08%) compared to the C4. 5 algorithm and C4. 5 LH. Besides, in terms of the excecution time, the C4. 5 LHP algorithm is faster than the C4. 5 algorithm.",

    deskripsi:
      "Gas leaks are one of the big problems in the industrial sector, even starting to spread to other sectors. One of the solutions to reduce losses due to gas leakage is to detect it early when there is a leak. There are already many technologies that help prevent gas leaks harm humans more, one of them is the mobile sensor. The development of mobile sensors is one way to overcome losses both from material and non-material. Using a gas sensor of type MQ-2 as a detector, it is expected that later it can be overcome before it has a wider impact. The gas sensor is connected to a mobile sensor and installed in four different directions. MQ-2 was chosen because it has a low price and good durability. Assisted by the SLAM method as navigation and a combination of source-seeking and active-sensing localization methods as identifiers of leak points, the mobile sensor identifies points of leakage which are on the abnormal …",

      "An Interaction Between User and an Augmented Reality System using A Generalized Finite State Automata and A Universal Turing Machine",
    deskripsi:
      "Most interactions between users and augmented reality system (ARS) are that user assigns a marker to ARS, and the ARS responds the marker. In this context, a marker is mapped to an ARS's response, or in general, an array of markers is mapped to an array of ARS's responses. This interaction is a constant or linear complexity interaction since there is only a bijective mapping between a set of markers and a set of ARS's responses. In this research, we propose the expansion of user-ARS complexity into the polynomial. It is an interaction in which not only one marker for a single response (or an array of markers for an array of ARS's responses), but the interaction by which user provides a string of markers as a word of markers (ie, a combination of multiple markers as a word) for a single ARS's response. The set of strings of markers to the ARS provided by users built a regular language. So that, the complexity of the user-ARS interaction became polynomial. This interaction was implemented by stating the user's language by means of a generalization of finite state automata (gFSA) and placing a universal Turing machine (UTM) between user and ARS, where the UTM as an interpreter translating or mapping the user language to ARS. To summarize our research, overall we apply the idea of a formal language into the interaction between the user and ARS, thereby changing the complexity of the interaction to polynomial even expandable to nondeterministic polynomials.",

The system has two modes: formal learning mode (FLM) and group competition mode (GCM). The first mode, FLM, is designed to allow students to observe teacher's key pressing and finger movement directly from their HMDs so as to enhance mutual understanding between the two parties during the learning process. The second mode, GCM, is developed to further ignite students' passion on learning piano via competition among students. Our goal is to exploit AR technologies for enhancing the learning fun and enthusiasm of beginner-level students on a group piano learning situation, and thus ultimately provide students with a great learning experience.",

      "MPI process mapping is an important step to achieve scalable performance on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems. Conventional approaches have focused only on improving the locality of communication. However, related studies have shown that on modern NUMA systems, the memory congestion problem could cause more severe performance degradation than the locality problem because a high number of processor cores in the systems can cause heavy congestion on shared caches and memory controllers. To optimize the process mapping, it is necessary to determine the communication behavior of the MPI processes. Previous methods rely on offline profiling to analyze the communication behavior, which incurs a high overhead and is potentially time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a method that automatically performs MPI process mapping for adapting to communication behaviors while …",

      "Background: Indonesia is an active Twitter user that is the largest ranked in the world. Tweets written by Twitter users vary, from tweets containing positive to negative responses. This agreement will be utilized by the parties concerned for evaluation. Objective: On public comments there are emoticons and sarcasm which have an influence on the process of sentiment analysis. Emoticons are considered to make it easier for someone to express their feelings but not a few are also other opinion researchers, namely by ignoring emoticons, the reason being that it can interfere with the sentiment analysis process, while sarcasm is considered to be produced from the results of the sarcasm sentiment analysis in it. Methods: The emoticon and no emoticon categories will be tested with the same testing data using classification method are Naïve Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine. Sarcasm data will be proposed using the Random Forest Classifier, Naïve Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine method. Results: The use of emoticon with sarcasm detection can increase the accuracy value in the sentiment analysis process using Naïve Bayes Classifier method. Conclusion: Based on the results, the amount of data greatly affects the value of accuracy. The use of emoticons is excellent in the sentiment analysis process. The detection of superior sarcasm only by using the Naïve Bayes Classifier method due to differences in the amount of sarcasm data and not sarcasm in the research process.",

Kulonprogo Regency is one of the malaria endemic areas that needs to be developed to combat malaria. This research aims to describe the distribution of malaria cases to determine vulnerable areas in Kulonprogo Regency. This research was an observational analytic with cross sectional design conducted between April and October 2018, based on a sampling of 62 malaria cases. Data analysis was performed using a Geographic Information System approach with overlay, buffer, cluster techniques, and spatial weighted regression. Based on the results of the partial analysis, it was found that 62 cases of malaria spread in 6 sub-districts namely: Kokap, Pengasih, Samigaluh, Kalibawang, Wates and Sentolo. The distribution of malaria cases clustered in Kokap Sub District, namely in Kalirejo Village (29 cases) and Hargorejo Village (9 cases). The overlay and buffer techniques found that the distribution of cases spread in Menoreh hills which have forest vegetation. Malaria-prone areas in Kulonprogo Regency were found in Kalirejo Village and Hargorejo Village through the results of spatial analysis using a Geographic Information System approach. Thus, malaria control efforts were focused on these vulnerable areas.",

    deskripsi:
      "Objectives The aim of this study is to propose a method that automatically select the trabecular bone area in digital periapical radiographic images using a sequence of morphological operations. Methods The study involved 50 digital periapical radiographic images of women aged from 36 to 58 years old. The proposed method consists of three stages: teeth detection, trabecular identification, and validation. A series of morphological operations—top-hat and bottom-hat filtering, automatic thresholding, closing, labeling, global thresholding, and image subtraction—are performed to automatically obtain the trabecular bone area in images. For validation, the results of the proposed method were compared with those of two dentists pixel by pixel. Three parameters were used in the validation: trabecular area, percentage of agreed area, and percentage of disagreed area. Results The proposed method obtains the trabecular bone area in a polygon. The obtained trabecular bone area is usually larger than that of previous studies, but is usually smaller than the dentists'. On average over all images, the trabecular area produced by the proposed method is 5.83% smaller than that identified by dentists. Furthermore, the average percentage of agreed area and the average percentage of disagreed area of the proposed method against the dentists' results were 75.22% and 8.75%, respectively. Conclusions The shape of the trabecular bone area produced by the proposed method is similar and closer to that identified by dentists.

One of the best methods for computing matrix exponential is via Padé approximation combined with scaling and squaring. In this paper we propose a method for parallelizing this Padé approximation of matrix exponential by performing its computation on a cluster of computers equipped with graphic processing units connected by CUDA-aware message passing interface. The main purpose of this parallelization is to allow for the computation of exponential of large matrices that may no longer fit in memory, while still retaining reasonable speed.

    judul: "Parallelization of Uniformization Algorithm with CUDA-Aware MPI",
    deskripsi:
      "Uniformization is one of the best methods for computing the transient probabilities of continuous-time Markov chains. In this paper, we propose a method for parallelizing uniformization by performing its computation on graphic processing units residing on several computers communicating with each other via message passing interface. Since Markov chain models are usually sparse, hypergraph partition is used to reduce communications among the computers when performing repeated sparse matrix-vector multiplication operations. This method of parallelization in principle allows for unlimited scalability while still maintains computation speed. Indeed, our results show that the proposed method can solve large models faster. However, our results also show that up to 90% of the computation time is actually still spent for communications between computers.",

      "Toward an optimal anomaly detection pattern in wireless sensor networks",
    deskripsi:
      "Over the past years, various anomaly detection techniques for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been proposed in the literature. These detectors are generally only effective against particular security threats and thus many detectors have to be executed to ensure high-level security in WSNs. Due to the hardware limitations, WSNs cannot execute all of these detectors simultaneously. Thus, WSNs have to appropriately schedule when to execute a particular detector and when to execute the others. This paper presents an optimized solution by providing a unified framework that combines the usage of a costly yet highly-accurate detector, called an oracle detector, and a low cost and less-accurate detector, called a partial detector. A detection pattern is created and optimized using a first-order approximation method. Simulation results show that combining several detectors into an optimized pattern is essential to …",

    deskripsi:
      "Instagram (IG) is a web-based and mobile social media application where users can share photos or videos with available features. Upload photos or videos with captions that contain an explanation of the photo or video that can reap spam comments. Comments on spam containing comments that are not relevant to the caption and photos. The problem that arises when identifying spam is non-spam comments are more dominant than spam comments so that it leads to the problem of the imbalanced dataset. A balanced dataset can influence the performance of a classification method. This is the focus of research related to the implementation of the CNB method in dealing with imbalance datasets for the detection of Instagram spam comments. The study used TF-IDF weighting with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as a comparison classification. Based on the test results with 2500 training data and 100 test data on the imbalanced dataset (25% spam and 75% non-spam), the CNB accuracy was 92%, precision 86% and f-measure 93%. Whereas SVM produces 87% accuracy, 79% precision, 88% f-measure. In conclusion, the CNB method is more suitable for detecting spam comments in cases of imbalanced datasets.",

      "Extended Kalman Filter In Recurrent Neural Network: USDIDR Forecasting Case Study",
    deskripsi:
      "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) especially Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been widely used to predict currency exchange rates. The learning algorithm that is commonly used in ANN is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). One of the advantages of SGD is that the computational time needed is relatively short. But SGD also has weaknesses, including SGD requiring several hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter. Besides that SGD relatively requires a lot of epoch to reach convergence. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) as a learning algorithm on RNN is used to replace SGD with the hope of a better level of accuracy and convergence rate. This study uses IDR/USD exchange rate data from 31 August 2015 to 29 August 2018 with 70% data as training data and 30% data as test data. This research shows that RNN-EKF produces better convergent speeds and better accuracy compared to RNN-SGD.",

      "In the data era, outlier detection methods play an important role. The existence of outliers can provide clues to the discovery of new things, irregularities in a system, or illegal intruders. Based on the data, outlier detection methods can be classified into numerical, categorical, or mixed-attribute data. However, the study of the outlier detection methods is generally conducted for numerical data. Meanwhile, many real-life facts are presented in mixed-attribute data. In this paper, the researcher presents a survey of outlier detection methods for mixed-attribute data. The methods are classified into four types, namely, categorized, enumerated, combined, and mixed outlier detection methods for mixed-attribute data. Through this classification, the methods can be easily analyzed and improved by applying appropriate functions.",

      "The use of CCTV cameras is increasingly widespread, both on campus, industry, shops and in other strategic places. With CCTV cameras almost all activities in the area that are reachable to the camera will be recorded, but the problem with CCTV cameras is the capacity of the image or video storage is very large. To overcome the above problems, we need a method of compressing and decompressing CCTV camera images whose compression ratio is quite high and the compression and decompression process are expected to be fast. First, discussed how to compress and decompress of the color image using fractal methods, that is using the iterative function system (SFI), so the process of compression and the decompression are expected to be fast. Then, a computer program is build that is able to compress and decompress images using the fractal method, the test images used are CCTV camera results at FMIPA UGM, color images with 256 x 144 resolution. The results of analysis of the computer program, that are the compression ratio for all the image is 3.2 while the value of PSNR depends on the number of iterations performed in the decompression process, the average value of PSNR for the number of iterations of 25 of the 5 test images is 19,298 with an average RMSE of 20,886. The time needed for the compression process is much slower than the time for the decompression process, this is because the time complexity of the algorithm used for compression is O (n4) while for decompression is O (n2).",

    deskripsi:
      "Implementation of automation technology for grading tobacco leaf was very promising. In Indonesia, grading tobacco leaf was done manually and relied on the skill and experience of tobacco leaf graders. Large tobacco plantation needed many graders, and the workers needed to be trained, to become a skilled grader. It would take a long time and substantial cost to prepare sufficient graders. Even if the plantation had enough graders, monotonous and long duration of work would raise the human error. Therefore, we proposed a method for grading tobacco leaf based on color and quality using image processing techniques. This work covered quality inspection of tobacco leaf, namely leaf defect detection and classification of tobacco leaf based on color. Image processing techniques such as image thresholding, morphological operation, blob detection, and color analysis of tobacco leaf were employed to determine the grade of tobacco leaf. From the experiment, the proposed method was able to detect a leaf defect and able to classify tobacco leaf with 91.667% accuracy.",

Data from the Directorate General of Horticulture at the Ministry of Agriculture in 2017 showed that 94, 3% of the total yield of citrus fruits is a type of tangerine. In the classification of the quality, the visual observation process is strongly influenced by subjectivity so that in certain conditions such as tired eyes and the number of oranges that want to classify too many the process can be inconsistent and also take a long time. Therefore, a technology is needed to accelerate the classification process and make it more objective. This study combines the Gray level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method for texture, Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) features for color features and the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification method. The data used were 60 images of rotten tangerines and 60 images of not rotten tangerines divided using a 4-fold cross-validation method to find the best combination of data training and data testing. 3 main processes will be carried out, namely preprocessing, feature extraction and classification. This study produced the highest accuracy of 80% from the combined of GLCM and HSV features extraction with value k= 5 for k-NN.",

      "Pengaruh Pembagian Data terhadap Proses Pelatihan Extreme Learning Machine",
    deskripsi:
      "Dalam extreme learning machine, pelatihan dengan data latih yang banyak jumlahnya akan memakan waktu yang lama karena melibatkan perhitungan operasi matriks dengan ukuran yang sangat besar dan memerlukan memori yang besar. Untuk mengatasi hal tersebut, diusulkan sebuah metode untuk melatih extreme learning machine dengan beberapa subdata yang lebih kecil dan selanjutnya bobot-bobot keluaran optimal tersebut akan digabung menjadi satu bobot keluaran optimal. Studi teoretis dan studi eksperimental antara proses pelatihan extreme learning machine tanpa partisi data latih dan dengan partisi data latih juga dilakukan. Untuk dataset pendigits, banyak kelompok subdata untuk meminimalkan waktu proses pelatihan adalah 4. Sedangkan untuk dataset usps dan mnist, banyak kelompok subdata untuk meminimalkan waktu proses pelatihan adalah 3. In extreme learning machine, training with large numbers of training data will take a long time because it involves operations for a very large size matrix and require a large memory. To overcome this, a method for training extreme learning machine with several smaller subdatas is proposed and then the optimal output weights will be combined into one optimal output weight. Theoretical studies and experimental studies between the extreme learning machine training process with and without splitting the data training were carried out. For pendigits datasets, the number of subdata groups so that the training process time is minimum is 4. As for the usps and mnist datasets, the number of subdata groups so that the training process time is minimum is 3.",

      "Deep Belief Networks for Recognizing Handwriting Captured by Leap Motion Controller",
    deskripsi:
      "Leap Motion controller is an input device that can track hands and fingers position quickly and precisely. In some gaming environment, a need may arise to capture letters written in the air by Leap Motion, which cannot be directly done right now. In this paper, we propose an approach to capture and recognize which letter has been drawn by the user with Leap Motion. This approach is based on Deep Belief Networks (DBN) with Resilient Backpropagation (Rprop) fine-tuning. To assess the performance of our proposed approach, we conduct experiments involving 30,000 samples of handwritten capital letters, 8,000 of which are to be recognized. Our experiments indicate that DBN with Rprop achieves an accuracy of 99.71%, which is better than DBN with Backpropagation or Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), either with Backpropagation or with Rprop. Our experiments also show that Rprop makes the process of fine-tuning significantly faster and results in a much more accurate recognition compared to ordinary Backpropagation. The time needed to recognize a letter is in the order of 5,000 microseconds, which is excellent even for online gaming experience.",

      "Investigating the Effects of Dynamic Thread Team Size Adjustment for Irregular Applications",
    deskripsi:
      "The OpenMP specification introduces thread team for hierarchical parallelism. A thread team is a team of synchronizable threads, and the number of threads in a thread team is called thread team size. OpenMP allows static adjustment of the thread team size, where the team size must be specified before executing an application and has to stay constant until the end of the execution. Conventionally, the thread team size is decided by evenly dividing the number of running threads, and assigning them to each thread team. However, the conventional approach will face load imbalance across thread teams when it is applied to irregular applications. Therefore, assigning the same team size for every thread team and keeping the size constant during the whole lifetime of the thread teams could be ineffective. In this paper, we discuss the effects of a dynamic thread team size adjustment method for OpenMP. After dynamic …",

      "Convenience in online transactions on B2C website is an essential thing in the business processes. Comfort and ease of use in human and computer interaction are called usability. Therefore, developers and online store’s owners are highly recommended to evaluate the usability of B2C e-commerce websites to find the extent of the severity of a website. Previous research states that the Extent Analysis (EA) approach to the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method is one way to determine the weight of the usability criteria. However, it turns out there are other ways to derive the weight of the criteria in the FAHP method, which is a non-linear programming approach called Fuzzy Preference Programming (FPP). This study aims to compare EA and FPP approach to determine the proper ones on evaluating B2C website usability. A comparative analysis shows that these two methods have significant …",

    deskripsi:
      "Objectives The retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) is a site of glaucomatous optic neuropathy whose early changes need to be detected because glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness. This paper proposes an automated RNFL detection method based on the texture feature by forming a co-occurrence matrix and a backpropagation neural network as the classifier. Methods We propose two texture features, namely, correlation and autocorrelation based on a co-occurrence matrix. Those features are selected by using a correlation feature selection method. Then the backpropagation neural network is applied as the classifier to implement RNFL detection in a retinal fundus image. Results We used 40 retinal fundus images as testing data and 160 sub-images (80 showing a normal RNFL and 80 showing RNFL loss) as training data to evaluate the performance of our proposed method. Overall, this work achieved an accuracy of 94.52%. Conclusions Our results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved a high accuracy, which indicates good performance.",

    deskripsi:
      "Peripapillary atrophy (PPA) is one indication of glaucoma and myopia that can be examined in color fundus images. Glaucoma is an eye disease that causes the second largest loss of vision in the world, while myopia is generally suffered by adults and even children. PPA needs to be detected so that both diseases can also be detected earlier. In this work, we propose a method of features extraction and classification for automatic detection of PPA. In the features extraction stage, the texture features are statistical values generated from the extraction area. The extraction area is divided into two areas: no-PPA and suspect-PPA. The no-PPA area captures the area with no PPA, while the suspect-PPA captures the area where PPA may be present. In order to detect the presence of PPA in the extraction area, we propose a knowledge base technique for classification. Our method obtains the accuracy of 0.92, 0.90, and 0 …",

    deskripsi:
      "Checkpointing with a constant checkpoint interval, a so-called constant checkpointing method, is commonly used in HPC field and has been proved to be the optimal solution for failures whose inter-arrival times are distributed exponentially. On the other hand, previous works have shown that there is a high correlation between processor temperature and its failure rate. By analyzing the results of the temperature monitoring on a parallel application, we noticed that the failure rate is dynamically changing and the failure inter-arrival times do not follow an exponential distribution. Under such a scenario, the constant checkpointing method is not the optimal solution and thus a checkpointing method with an adaptive checkpoint interval, called an adaptive checkpointing method, is required to achieve high performance. However, to use the adaptive method, the processor temperature must be constantly monitored in order …",

The procedure of transliteration presupposes that the workers fully understand how to read the manuscript, that no consideration is given to the length of the work, and that workers will concentrate sufficiently to minimize errors in rewriting. There are 3 main steps for Javanese manuscript image transliteration, ie, segmenting manuscript, transliterating of Javanese script letters or numbers, and grouping syllables. The implementation of the proposed model was tested on a Javanese manuscript with catalogue number SB. 141 and at a confidence level of 95% and resulting in a success rate between 69.20% and 87.29%.",

This algorithm is implemented in MRMC, a tool for verifying properties over probabilistic and stochastic models. MRMC uses a compressed-row representation to store sparse matrices. The representation is customized to meet MRMC's needs to store transient probability matrix and other necessary matrices. It is also used to store transient probability matrices that are constantly produced and used by discretization. However, the representation is not quite compatible for discretization when computing probabilities of high accuracy.

The second is the many different parameters used to determine the referral hospitals between countries. Based on these issues, it is necessary to improve the current systems’ capabilities. This study develops a model of an e-referral information system that takes into account patients’ background. Some of the methods used in the model include information technology for patient care and Fuzzy Multiple-Criteria Decision Making to determine referral hospitals that fit patients’ background. The result of this study is an intelligent system model to find referral hospitals that are most suitable to patients’ backgound. In order to evaluate the model, we accumulate opinions of experts whether the output of the developed model matches the decisions taken by the experts. The evaluation indicates that the model obtains a conformity level of 81.45%.",

    judul: "A coarse-grained parallelization of genetic algorithms",
    deskripsi:
      "Genetic algorithms (GA) are frequently used to solve scheduling, shortest paths, machine learning, and modeling problems. Genetic algorithms are basically a search and optimization technique. The working mechanism of GA is based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. On the other hands, the must be solved problems become more complex and bigger. Consequently, it takes much longer times and more advance objective functions to find optimal solutions. Until now, time complexity analysis is still developed to get a good performance estimation of genetic algorithms [1]. Since the complexity may certainly affect its processing time, a novel approach should be done to improve the GA performance. This paper investigates a new method to increase the GA speed of genetic algorithms in finding the optimal solutions by parallelizing the processing of subpopulations. Splitting the population into subpopulations may prevent premature convergence since each subpopulation finds a different genetic combination. The proposed method employs two levels of parallelization: message passing and Single Instruction Multiple Threads (SIMT). On the first level, message passing is used because of its ability to connect more than one computer, and hence to provide, in principle, unlimited scalability. Previous researches, such as Liu and Wang [2], have shown the feasibility of this parallelization. On the second level, SIMT is used because it can generate a large number of threads and one individual can, therefore, be processed by one thread, as shown in Zhang and He [3]. Rapid advances in the technology of general purpose Graphics …",

      "This work proposes a method for detecting stationary objects in a vision-based smart monitoring system. A stationary object is defined as an object that previously moves, but currently remains stable in a certain location. The case samples for such objects include abandoned objects and illegally parked vehicles, whose surveillance is a crucial task for ensuring public safety and security. The proposed method is based on dual background modeling for separating foreground from background. To extract the candidates of stationary objects, a Gaussian mixture model-based cumulative dual foreground difference is implemented. An SVM-based object classifier is then integrated to verify the region candidates whether they are vehicle, human, or other objects. If the object is classified as either vehicle or baggage, the duration of the object being stable is counted using detection-based tracking. If the duration exceeds a …",

      "Development of a Spatial Path-Analysis Method for Spatial Data Analysis",
    deskripsi:
      "Path analysis is a method for identifying and analyzing direct and indirect relationship between independent and dependent variables. This method was developed by Sewal Wright and initially only used correlation analysis results in identifying the variables’ relationship. So far, path analysis has been mostly used to deal with variables of non-spatial data type. When analyzing variables that have elements of spatial dependency, path analysis could result in a less precise model. Therefore, it is necessary to build a path analysis model that is able to identify and take into account the effects of spatial dependencies. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression methods can be used to enhance path analysis to identify the effects of spatial dependencies. This paper proposes a method derived from path analysis that can process data with spatial elements and furthermore can be used to identify and analyze the spatial …",

    deskripsi:
      "Pada sistem pendidikan nasional, guru merupakan komponen utama keberhasilan sistem. Selama ini penugasan guru hanya didasarkan pada kebutuhan sekolah, tidak memandang alamat rumah dari guru yang ditugaskan. Hal ini berakibat adanya sejumlah guru yang harus menempuh perjalanan yang sangat jauh untuk mengajar. Keterlambatan datang dan kelelahan guru menjadikan proses belajar mengajar kurang efektif. Guru yang demikian ini dapat dipandang sebagai outlier. Outlier merupakan objek yang berbeda dibandingkan objek-objek lainnya. Pada penelitian ini akan dilakukan deteksi outlier dalam penugasan guru di Propinsi Daerah Isimewa Yogyakarta. Pada kasus ini, outlier merupakan guru-guru yang harus menempuh perjalanan sangat jauh untuk mencapai sekolah tempat mengajarnya. Deteksi outlier dilakukan dengan menggunakan metode Boxplot. Untuk mengurangi jarak tempuh guru maka diusulkan pertukaran penempatan kerja guru. Metode Greedy digunakan untuk memilih pasangan pertukaran penempatan guru sehingga distribusi guru merata dan jarak tempuh guru secara keseluruhan dapat dikurangi.",

Most of these researches have been focused on tweets written in English. Previous researches on trending topics detection on Indonesian tweets are still relatively few. In this paper, we compare two methods, namely document pivot and BN-grams, for detecting trending topics on Indonesian tweets. In our experiments, we examine the effects of varying the number of topics, n-grams, stemming, and aggregation on the quality of the resulting trending topics. We measure the accuracy of trending topics detection by comparing both algorithms with trending topics found in local news and Twitter trending topics. The results of our experiments show that using ten topics produces the highest topic recall; that using trigrams in BN-grams results in the highest value topic …",

      "Thermalaware dynamic checkpoint interval tuning for high performance computing",
    deskripsi:
      "Checkpointing with a fixed checkpoint interval, a so-called constant checkpointing method, is commonly used in the field of faulttolerance for high-performance computing (HPC) systems. It can achieve minimum total execution time if the failure follows an exponential distribution. Related work show that there is a high correlation between temperature and reliability. By analyzing the results of the CPU temperatures monitoring on several applications, we noticed that the change of the failure rate does not follow an exponential distribution. In this paper, a dynamic checkpoint interval adjustment method based on CPU temperature monitoring is proposed. It can minimize the execution time since the checkpoint interval is adaptive to the change of the failure rates. The method predicts the change of the failure rate by utilizing a low-overhead prediction method. The simulation results show that the method can achieve a shorter execution time compared to the constant checkpointing method.",

We evaluate the proposed method using NPB applications on a NUMA system. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve up to 20% performance improvement compared with locality-based and balance-based methods.",

    deskripsi:
      "Library services quality is one of the most vital parts in library management. Evaluation of the library services based on the perspective of users is important. In this paper, we propose a collaboration of GDSS-AHP (Group Decision Support System-Analytical Hierarchy Process), LibQual, and IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) methods to evaluate library services quality. The collaboration of GDSS-AHP and LibQual is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation statement and the level of library services quality based on users’ perception and expectation. IPA is then used to determine the position of the value of each evaluation statement in IPA’s four quadrants to obtain the recommended level for the library services improvement. This study is conducted at the Library of the Ministry of Trade of Indonesia, involving four decision makers: a head librarian, a library academic expert, and two library practitioners. Fifty library visitors become respondents to assess the quality services questionnaires. Based on their responses, we obtain that users’ satisfaction level is at least satisfied by 76.49%. Meanwhile, usability testing is also conducted on the developed system by using three observation elements: effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The usability testing is performed on five respondents, one admin, and two decision makers, and results in an average usability level of 90.03%.",

    deskripsi:
      "Retrieval is one of the stages in case-based reasoning system which find a solution to new problem or case by measuring the similarity between the new case and old cases in the case base. Some of the similarity measurement techniques are involving feature weights that show the importance of the feature in a case. Feature weights can be obtained from a domain expert or by using a feature weighting method either locally or globally. Gradient descent is the feature weighting method which computes global weights for each feature. This research implemented gradient descent to obtain feature weights in case-based reasoning for hepatitis diagnosis and the similarity measurement using weighted Euclidean distance. There were four variations of case base size and test data used in the research; ie, 50% of case base and 50% of test data, 60% of case base and 40% of test data, 70% of case base and 30% of test data, and 80% of case base and 20% of test data were variation 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. In addition, each variation used four scenarios based on the way how to mark the test data. In scenario 1, 2, 3 and 4, the test data were respectively marked at the end, the beginning, the half of beginning and half of end, and the middle. The result showed that the accuracy of the system reaches 100% at scenario 1 in variation 4. Overall of all four variations and four kinds of scenario, the average accuracy of the system was 77.55%, average recall of system was 69.74%, and the average of precision was 78.39%. In addition, the level of accuracy was also influenced by the number of case base and the scenario of case selection for the case base …",

Uniformization is preferable for reasons of its numerical stability, pre-determined error bounds and acceptable time complexity. However, latest results reveal that computation of matrix exponentials can be carried out much more efficiently than before. In this paper, we compare uniformization and matrix exponential—through Padé approximation—coupled with the scaling and squaring method tailored to the IEEE floatingpoint specification. We show that, in certain circumstances, the use of Padé approximation is advisable, even though in most cases uniformization performs better.",

A recent study on NUMA architectures has shown that, on modern NUMA systems, the memory congestion problem could cause more severe performance degradation than the data locality problem because heavy congestion on memory controllers could cause long latencies. However, conventional work on MPI process placement has focused on locality to minimize the remote-access communication. Moreover, maximizing the locality may actually degrade performance because the load imbalance among nodes in a modern NUMA system may increase. Thus, a process placement algorithm must be designed to consider memory congestion. In this paper, a method to reconcile both the locality and the memory congestion on modern NUMA systems is proposed. This method …",

      "The best known deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for primality testing right now is due to Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena. This algorithm has a time complexity O (log^{15/2}(n)). Although this algorithm is polynomial, its reliance on the congruence of large polynomials results in enormous computational requirement. In this paper, we propose a parallelization technique for this algorithm based on message-passing parallelism together with four workload-distribution strategies. We perform a series of experiments on an implementation of this algorithm in a high-performance computing system consisting of 15 nodes, each with 4 CPU cores. The experiments indicate that our proposed parallelization technique introduce a significant speedup on existing implementations. Furthermore, the dynamic workload-distribution strategy performs better than the others. Overall, the experiments show that the parallelization obtains up to 36 times speedup.",

      "Coordinated checkpointing is a widely-used checkpoint/restart protocol for fault-tolerance in large-scale HPC systems. However, this protocol will involve massive amounts of I/O concentration, resulting in considerably high checkpoint overhead and high energy consumption. This paper focuses on speculative checkpointing , a CPR mechanism that allows for temporal distribution of checkpointings to avoid I/O concentration. We propose execution time and energy models for speculative checkpointing, and investigate energy-performance characteristics when speculative checkpointing is adopted in exascale systems. Using these models, we study the benefit of speculative checkpointing over coordinated checkpointing under various realistic scenarios for exascale HPC systems. We show that, compared to coordinated checkpointing, speculative checkpointing can achieve up to a 11% energy reduction at the cost of …",

      "Improved Face Recognition across Poses using Fusion of Probabilistic Latent Variable Models",
    deskripsi:
      "Uncontrolled environments have often required face recognition systems to identify faces appearing in poses that are different from those of the enrolled samples. To address this problem, probabilistic latent variable models have been used to perform face recognition across poses. Although these models have demonstrated outstanding performance, it is not clear whether richer parameters always lead to performance improvement. This work investigates this issue by comparing performance of three probabilistic latent variable models, namely PLDA, TFA, and TPLDA, as well as the fusion of these classifiers on collections of video data. Experiments on the VidTIMIT+ UMIST and the FERET datasets have shown that fusion of multiple classifiers improves face recognition across poses, given that the individual classifiers have similar performance. This proves that different probabilistic latent variable models learn statistical properties of the data that are complementary (not redundant). Furthermore, fusion across multiple images has also been shown to produce better perfomance than recogition using single still image.",

      "Although incremental checkpointing is an effective way of reducing the checkpointing overhead, it has been discussed mostly for system-level checkpointing. Since the whole memory space of a running application is saved in a checkpoint file, system-level checkpointing will be less practical for future-generation extreme-scale computing systems, in which the I/O operation is much more expensive than the computation, especially in terms of power consumption. In this work, hence, the idea of incremental checkpointing is applied to application-level checkpointing, in which programmers explicitly specify the simulation data to be saved into a checkpoint file so that only necessary data for resuming the simulation are saved. This work assumes that, in incremental checkpointing, a management region consisting of multiple memory pages is written to a checkpoint file only if any page in the management region has been …",

      "The rapid use of the internet in education field encourages website developers to make improvements in university website quality. University websites are also part of the criteria of a higher education institution performance appraisal. Thus, a good university is considered to have a good website. The website reflects the popularity and prestige of a college. There are at least three university ranking agencies of the world with different ratings on the quality of the website. Due to several elaborated and numerous criteria, the quality rating of the website is often associated with Multi-Criteria Decision-Making issues. Linear Weightage Model (LWM) and Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) are the simplest algorithm for data rank. This paper aims to compare LWM and SAW algorithm performance to determine the best method on ranking University websites. This research uses five testing of usability criteria: load time, page …",

      "Coordinated checkpointing is a widely-used checkpoint/restart (CPR) technique for fault-tolerance in large-scale HPC systems. However, this CPR technique will involve massive amounts of I/O concentration, resulting in considerably high checkpoint overhead and high energy consumption. This paper focuses on multi-level checkpointing that allows the use of different kinds of fast but less reliable storages to reduce the checkpointing frequency to parallel file system (PFS). This paper presents an energy model of multi-level checkpointing and proposes an iterative algorithm that minimizes energy consumption by optimizing the checkpoint interval of each level and selecting the best combination of checkpoint levels. It is confirmed that the algorithm is very fast and effective since it can reach convergence in a relatively small number of iteration steps.

In this paper, an approach to classifying human carrying baggage region on surveillance video is proposed. The proposed approach utilized transfer learning strategy under convolution neural network with human pose direction attribute. For this purpose, we first constructed convolution neural network with the target including the presence of baggage and viewing direction of the human region. The network kernels are then fine-tuned to learning a new task in verifying whether the human carrying baggage or not. Rather than using the entire human region as input to the network, we divided the region into several sub-regions and assign them as a channel of the input layer.

      "Genetic algorithm is a population-based evolutionary optimization approach, and this has been used to train artificial neural networks successfully. When a large number of individuals make up the population, however, the running time of the algorithm often becomes very long. Parallel computation is a technique that can potentially be used to address this issue. This research investigates the adoption of parallel genetic algorithm for searching optimal parameters of artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptrons). Paralellization is conducted using Message Passing Interface, where sub-populations (and their fitness values) are exchanged between processors while selection, crossover, and mutation processes, which are necessary to generate new sub-populations, are performed independently between processors. Experiments of this research show that parallelization has indeed reduced the running time of …",

Essentially those algorithms differ only in their load-balancing methods. The result is, for exponents of length up to 2048 bits, the implementation of Lara et al.'s algorithm results in 28.01% faster running time compared to the implementation of the sequential algorithm.

This paper introduces a new approach for detecting and classifying baggage carried by a human on the images. It utilizes the spatial information of the baggage in reference to the body of the human carrying it. A human-baggage detector is modeled by the body parts of a human, including the head, torso, leg, and baggage parts. The feature descriptors are extracted for each part based on its characteristics and these features are further trained using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. A mixture model is built specifically for the baggage part due to a significant variation in shape, size, color, and texture. The boosting strategy constructs a strong classifier by combining a set of weak classifiers which are obtained by training the body …",

    deskripsi:
      "Data originating from some specific fields, for instance tourist arrivals, may exhibit a high degree of fluctuations as well as non-linear characteristics due to time varying behaviors. This paper proposes a new hybrid method to perform prediction for such data. The proposed hybrid model of wavelet transform and long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) is able to capture non-linear attributes in tourist arrival time series. Firstly, data is decomposed into constitutive series through wavelet transform. The decomposition is expressed as a function of a combination of wavelet coefficients, which have different levels of resolution. Then, LSTM neural network is used to train and simulate the value at each level to find the bias vectors and weighting coefficients for the prediction value. A sliding windows model is employed to capture the time series nature of the data. An evaluation is conducted to compare the proposed model with other RNN algorithms, ie, Elman RNN and Jordan RNN, as well as the combination of wavelet transform with each of them. The result shows that the proposed model has better performance in terms of training time than the original LSTM RNN, while the accuracy is better than the hybrid of wavelet-Elman and the hybrid of wavelet-Jordan.",

To maintain the accuracy of the reconstruction, the camera must also use correct parameter settings. This paper aims at designing a method to calibrate a camera to obtain its parameters and then using the method in the reconstruction of 3D images. Camera calibration is performed using region-based correlation methods. There are several steps necessary to follow. First, the world coordinate and the 2D image coordinate are measured. Extraction of intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters are then performed using singular value decomposition. Using the available disparity image and the parameters obtained through camera calibration, 3D leafimage reconstruction can finally be performed. Furthermore, the results of the experimental depth-map reconstruction using the intrinsic parameters of the camera show a rough surface, so that a smoothing process is necessary to improve the depth map.",

    deskripsi:
      "Image-based surveillance systems are widely employed toward safety and security applications in many fields. Cameras, that are connected over an IP network for monitoring public areas, can produce large quantities of video footage. It is tedious for humans to simultaneously observe every type of event on several cameras. Thus, it is necessary to build a user-friendly intelligent system, enabling the analysis of video to detect suspicious events. One of the most important tasks of this system would be to identify unattended objects to prevent an unexpected accident such as the bombing of a public space. This paper presents a novel technique for such a task. The method is based on a sequence of dual background differences, which is obtained by computing the intensity difference between the current and reference background models within a time period.

The main problem in the current referral system is that it is often quite slow. The process of obtaining a referral hospital still takes a long time because searching for hospitals involves contacting them one by one by telephone. The average time required to refer a patient is then more than 34 minutes, which is quite long because doctors in the primary health centers must contact an average of 5 hospitals. After obtaining a referral hospital, doctors at the hospital still have to perform a reexamination because the doctor at the primary health center often does not include the results of the initial examination. To resolve these problems, it is necessary to develop applications that can contact the referral hospitals simultaneously and can perform data transmission of the results of the initial …",

    deskripsi:
      "In traditional market, buyers are not only moving from one place to another, but also interacting with traders to purchase their products. When a buyer interacts with a trader, he blocks some space in the corridor. Besides, while buyers are walking, they may be attracted by non-preferred traders, though they may have preferred traders. These situations have not been covered in most existing crowd simulation models. Hence, these existing models cannot be directly implemented in traditional market environments since they mainly focus on crowd members’ movement. This research emphasizes on a crowd model that includes simplified movement and unplanned purchasing models. This model has been developed based on intelligent agent concept, where each agent represents a buyer. Two traditional markets are used for simulation in this research, namely Gedongkuning and Ngasem, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The simulation shows that some places are visited more frequently than others. Overall, the simulation result matches the situation found in the real world.",

Control actions however may perform something that makes the system experiences a state of overshoot before reaching the steady state. A fuzzy control system can be used to control the system to reach the steady state without overshoot. In this paper, a model of Mamdani's fuzzy inference process is proposed as the basis for this control. MIN operator is used for inference process if there is only one active rule, while MAX operator is used for composition of inferences if there are more than one active rule.

Firstly, every frame is enhanced using histogram equalization in pre-processing before feeding into foreground detection. After foreground mask is obtained from GMM, it is fed into post processing which uses morphological operations to improve output.

      "Measuring the similarity of two shapes is an important task in human vision systems in order to either recognize or classify the objects. For obtaining reliable results, a high discriminative shape descriptor should be extracted by considering both global and local information of the shape. Taking into account, this work introduces a centroid-based tree-structured (CENTREES) shape descriptor invariant to rotation and scale. Extracting the CENTREES descriptor is started by computing the central of mass of a binary shape, assigned as the root node of tree. The entire shape is then decomposed into b sub-shapes by voting each pixel point according to an angle between point and major principal axis relative to a centroid. In the same way, the central of mass of the sub-shapes are calculated and these locations are considered as level-1 nodes. These processes are repeated for a predetermined number of levels. For …",

      "Abstract The purpose of this study was to determine the general picture and constraints related to the implementation of the program JKN admissions, medical data processing, reporting and funding JKN in Puskesmas Gondokusuman II. The research is a qualitative descriptive and cross-sectional study design. Results showed that patients JKN reception starts from taking a queue number, then checking membership data, identification of other social identities, social data entry into a P-Care and SIMPUS and deliver medical records to the clinic. With the entry of data to be socially into P-Care and SIMPUS the time service is also getting old. JKN patient medical data processing is done with the patient's medical data entry into a P-Care and SIMPUS. However, not all patient medical data can be entry into a P-Care. Reporting JKN program consists of 10 visit reports and report diseases based on the type of membership JKN patients, namely Askes, JAMKESMAS and BPJS Mandiri. The report was sent to the City Health Office Yogyakarta each month. Funding JKN programs are of two kinds, namely based on capitation and non capitation. For capitation, health centers receive pembayarannnya every month. As for the non capitation funding, has not been running. JKN program implementation constraints related admissions, medical data processing, reporting and financing activities consisted of the elements of man, materials, machines, methods, markets and money.

      "Improving the performance of Outlier Detection Methods for Categorical Data by Using Weighting Function",
    deskripsi:
      "Outliers are uncommon events in real life. For a database processing, outlier means unusual records comparing to the remaining records. An outlier can be caused by a damage of a system. A new fact in a system can also cause outliers. Outlier detection is an important task to find an exceptional data. Outlier detection methods for categorical data such as AVF, MR-AVF, AEVF, NAVF, OPAVF, WDOD, and FuzzyAVF work base on the attribute value data frequency. These methods start the outlier detection process by calculating the data of attribute value frequency on each attribute. Then, many complicated calculations based on the various mathematical background are carried out to find the outlier, by using the data of attribute value frequency. All the methods above do not take into account on the sparseness of each attribute. In this article, weighting functions is used to take into account the sparseness of each …",

      "Multiscale car detection using oriented gradient feature and boosting machine",
    deskripsi:
      "In many car detection method, the candidate regions which have variation in size and aspect ratio are mostly resized into a fixed size in order to extract the same length dimensional feature. However, this process reduces local object information due to interpolation problem. Thus, this paper addresses a solution to solve a such problem by using Scalable Histogram of Oriented Gradient (SHOG). The SHOG enables to extract fixed-length dimensional features for any size of region without resizing the region to a fixed size. In addition, instead of using high dimensional features in training stage, our proposal divides the feature into several low-dimensional sub-features. Each sub-feature is trained using SVM, called weak classifier. Boosting strategy is applied for combining the weak classifier results for constructing a strong classifier. By conducting comprehensive experiments, it is found that the accuracy of SHOG is …",

    deskripsi:
      "The association between the subset of PROMELA's constructs (or statements) and the subset of Java's constructs is intended to provide a collection of rules that can be used as a reference in developing a model of code translator from a PROMELA model to a Java program. The idea arises from the fact that, both PROMELA model and Java program are built (or composed) by various elementary elements called constructs. Although this kind of association has already been introduced in some previous researches, they provided no proofs about its correctness. In this paper we propose a formal proof of association's correctness by showing the equivalence (or similarity) of the program graphs for every two associated constructs in the association. The correctness of association means that every two associated constructs in association have equivalent semantics. In addition, at the end of this paper we also introduce a …",

Its intuitive drag-and-drop approach considerably eases an often delicate modelling step in model-based performance and dependability evaluation, stochastic model checking, as well in the quantitative study of system-level concurrency phenomena. To compress the size of the representations, the app connects to a web service that implements an efficient compression algorithm, which constitutes the core technological innovation behind the approach. The app enables interested users to perform rapid experiments with this technology. From a more general perspective, this approach might pioneer how web service and app technology can provide a convenient vehicle for promoting and evaluating computer aided verification innovations.",

    deskripsi:
      "In recent years, light-emitting diodes dot-matrix text (LED text) is being widely used for displaying information and announcements. However, there is currently no text detection system that is capable of handling LED text. Unlike general printed text, it is not easy to detect and recognize LED text due to its discontinuity. A character of the LED is generally displayed with a matrix of segments and composed with them to generate the text. Furthermore, it is necessary to detect each character from a line of LED text for creating a robust text detection system. Thus, this paper proposes a method for LED text detection and recognition in natural scene images. To perform this goal of detection and recognition of a character and text, it consists of two main steps with the following steps: the first step, a Canny edge was used to detect character pixels which appear in LED display area from scene images.

      "The universe of acyclic continuous-time Markov chains can provide arbitrarily close approximations of any continuous probability distribution. We span this universe by a compositional construction calculus for acyclic phase-type distributions. The calculus draws its expressiveness from a single operator, yet the calculus is equipped with further convenient operators, namely convolution, maximum, and minimum. However, the size of the chains constructed in this way can grow rapidly. We therefore link our calculus to a compositional minimization algorithm that whenever applied almost surely yields a chain with the least possible size. The entire approach is available in the form of an easy-to-use web service. The paper describes the architecture of this service in detail and reports on experimental evidence demonstrating its usefulness.",

      "Automatic parameter tuning of hierarchical incremental checkpointing",
    deskripsi:
      "As future HPC systems become larger, the failure rates and the cost of checkpointing to the global file system are expected to increase. Hierarchical incremental CPR is a promising approach to solve this problem. It utilizes a hierarchical storage system of local and global storages and performs incremental checkpointing by writing only updated memory pages between two consecutive checkpoints. In this paper, we response to an open question; how to optimize the checkpoint interval when the checkpoint overheads are changing with time as in hierarchical incremental CPR. We propose a runtime checkpoint interval autotuning technique to optimize the efficiency of hierarchical incremental CPR. Evaluation results show that the efficiency can be significantly increased if the storage hierarchy can be exploited with appropriate checkpoint intervals.",

    deskripsi:
      "The success of a security attack crucially depends on time: the more time available to the attacker, the higher the probability of a successful attack; when given enough time, any system can be compromised. Insight in time-dependent behaviors of attacks and the evolution of the attacker’s success as time progresses is therefore a key for effective countermeasures in securing systems. This paper presents an efficient technique to analyze attack times for an extension of the prominent formalism of attack trees. If each basic attack step, i.e. , each leaf in an attack tree, is annotated with a probability distribution of the time needed for this step to be successful, we show how this information can be propagated to an analysis of the entire tree. In this way, we obtain the probability distribution for the entire system to be attacked successfully as time progresses. For our approach to be effective, we take great care to always work …",

    deskripsi:
      "identify plant. Researchers have made plant recognition based on leaf characteristics. The leaf image-based plant recognition in view of different angles is a new challenge. In this study, the research on the plant recognition was conducted based on leaf images resulted from 3D stereo camera. The 3D images are very influential in the development of computer vision theory, which can provide more detailed information of an object. One of the information that can be obtained is about the position of the object in its image with the background as well as of the camera. One of the ways used to obtain such information is to calculate the disparity. However, this method will only tell the position of the object compared to other objects without that of range. Sum Absolute Different (SAD) is a method that can be used to find the disparity value. The SAD method does not require heavy computations and long process. Before calculating the disparity, all the images should be previously segmented. The objective of this segmentation is to separate all the objects from the background. Furthermore, filtering and polynomial transformation at the results of disparity is necessary to improve the quality of resultant images. Furthermore, 22 features were extracted using GLCM features (second order statistics) of images resulted from disparity improvement. The highest accuracy of match in the recognition of plant varieties was obtained at 50 cm distance and in the recognition of three plant varieties was 83.3%.",

      "This paper presents a moving object detection method using optical flow in an image obtained from an omnidirectional camera mounted in a mobile robot. The moving object is extracted from the relative motion by segmenting the region representing the same optical flows after compensating the ego-motion of the camera. To obtain the optical flow, image is divided into grid windows and affine transformation is performed according to each window so that conformed optical flows are extracted. Moving objects are detected as transformed objects are different from the previously registered background. In omnidirectional and panoramic images, the optical flow seems to be emerging on focus of expansion (FOE), on the contrary, it to be vanishing on focus of contraction (FOC). FOE and FOC vectors are defined from the estimated optical flow and used as reference vectors for the relative evaluation of optical flow. In order …",

      "This paper introduces a novel shape descriptor invariant to rotation and scale, namely centroid-based tree-structured (CbTs), for measuring shape similarity. For obtaining CbTs descriptor, first, the central of mass of a binary shape is computed. It will be regarded as the root node of tree. The shape is divided into b sub-shapes by voting each foreground pixel point based on angle between point and major principal axis. In the same way, the central of masses of the sub-shapes are calculated and these locations are considered as level-1 nodes. These processes are repeated for a predetermined number of levels. For each node corresponding to sub-shapes, five parameters invariant to translation, rotation and scale are extracted. Thus, a vector of all parameters is carried out as descriptor. To measure dissimilarity between shapes, we employ vector-based template matching with X 2 distance measurement. Results …",

    deskripsi:
      "Foreign exchange market is one of the most complex dynamic market with high volatility, non linear and irregularity. As the globalization spread to the world, exchange rates forecasting become more important and complicated. Many external factors influence its volatility. To forecast the exchange rates, those external variables can be used and usually chosen based on the correlation to the predicted variable. A new second correlation method to improve forecasting accuracy is proposed. The second correlation is used to choose the external variable with different time interval. The proposed method is tested using six major monthly exchange rates with Nonlinear Autoregressive with eXogenous input (NARX) compared with Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) for model benchmarking. We evaluated the forecasting accuracy of proposed method is increasing by 16.8% compared to univariate NAR model and slight better than linear correlation on average for Dstat parameter and gives almost no improvement for MSE.",

The steps required to complete this are first, to perform camera calibration in order to extract camera parameters, and then to use these parameters to rectify the stereo image. Second, to perform segmentation to separate the object from the background of the image. Separation of the object from the background was performed to produce a good disparity for the object. This had not been done in previous studies. Using segmentation, bias and error of stereo correspondence had been reduced, since the correspondence was focus on the intensity of the left and right objects in the stereo image. Using rectified and segmented stereo images, better disparity maps had been obtained.",

      "Mesin-mesin Turing adalah suatu jenis abstraksi dari komputasi dan merupakan pemodelan yang sangat sederhana dari komputer. Mesin Turing sebagai model komputasi teoritis berfungsi sebagai model ideal untuk melakukan ilustrasi perhitungan/komputasi matematis. Meskipun model ideal ini diperkenalkan sebelum komputer nyata dibangun, model ini tetap diterima kalangan ilmu komputer sebagai model komputer yang sesuai untuk menentukan apakah suatu fungsi dapat diselesaikan oleh komputer atau tidak (menentukan computable function). Universalitas komputasi adalah kemampuan dari sebuah mesin atau program untuk menghitung iterasi dari mesin atau program lain. Oleh karena bukti yang ada dari universalitas komputasi hanya berkaitan dengan Mesin Turing yang asli, maka pembuktian universalitas komputasional bagi programprogram yang lain dapat dilaksanakan melalui emulasi. Emulasi berarti bahwa serangkaian iterasi dalam suatu program akan menghasilkan suatu representasi yang setara (equivalent) dengan setiap langkah komputasi dari program yang ditiru. Pada artikel ini akan dipaparkan secara singkat pengemulasian sebuah Celullar Automata terhadap Mesin Turing. Celullar Automata adalah sebuah model komputasi terdesentralisasi yang menyediakan sebuah platform yang mangkus bagi pelaksanaan suatu komputasi yang lebih komplek.",

      "This paper presents a technique to enhance accuracy of omnidirectional camera calibration which is applied structure from motion. We use two omnidirectional images of a predefined trihedron with checker board taken by a calibrate camera at an arbitrary location. Then, several point matches were picked manually from both views of the object. After that, compute and perform a 3D metric reconstruction of a real object from both images, by using the geometrical approach model estimated by single view calibration method. Then improved by the minimization error the distances among trihedral object use our proposed method. The overall experimental results show our proposed method gave smaller distance error.",

    deskripsi:
      "Newton method is a famous method for solving non linear equations numerically. This method is also suitable for solving systems of non linear equations. However, this method has a limitation because it requires the derivative of the non linear function which constructing the systems. The need of derivation some times lead to a problem. Secton method is a combination of Newton method and Secant method. Secton method omit the need of derivation of function. The performance of Secton method is almost same with Newton method. In this paper, Secton method is used to solve a non linear systems of equation. The experiments showed that Secton method could work well for solving non linear systems of equations.",

    deskripsi:
      "This paper addresses a method for light-emitting diode (LED) dot matrix text detection and recognition in natural scene images. Unlike general text detection and recognition, the LED text detection is quite difficult to be done due to discontinuous character. In our proposed method, first, the Canny edge detector is applied to produce an edge image. From the edge image, the interesting points representing the center of a blob are extracted. These interesting points then are merged based on their properties to generate a character component. Through feature-based template matching, the filtering and recognizing process are performed simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed method is reliable, effective and fast to detect and recognize the LED text in natural scene images which general text method does not cover.",

    deskripsi:
      "Facial landmarks play an important role in face recognition. They serve different steps of the recognition such as pose estimation, face alignment, and local feature extraction. Recently, cascaded shape regression has been proposed to accurately locate facial landmarks. A large number of weak regressors are cascaded in a sequence to fit face shapes to the correct landmark locations. In this paper, we propose to improve the method by applying gradual training. With this training, the regressors are not directly aimed to the true locations. The sequence instead is divided into successive parts each of which is aimed to intermediate targets between the initial and the true locations. We also investigate the incorporation of pose information in the cascaded model. The aim is to find out whether the model can be directly used to estimate head pose. Experiments on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild database …",

    deskripsi:
      "Permintaan akan barang atau produk tertentu sering kali berubah secara cepat. Perubahan tersebut dapat berupa kenaikan atau penurunan permintaan. Banyak hal yang mendasari perubahan permintaan tersebut, antara lain pengaruh cuaca, masa promo produk, kemunculan produk baru, hari libur, dan sebagainya. Para pelaku industri sering kali menghabiskan banyak sumber daya (dapat berupa uang, waktu, tenaga, dan sebagainya) guna menghindari efek dari perubahan permintaan tersebut. Salah satu efek dari perubahan permintaan tersebut yaitu kehabisan barang persediaan atau bahkan melimpahnya barang persediaan. Salah satu cara tersebut yaitu dengan melakukan peramalan permintaan. Pelaku permintaan yang dimaksud adalah reseller. Beberapa dekade terakhir, banyak metode yang digunakan untuk memecahkan masalah perbubahan permintaan. Metode yang cukup terkenal dan sering digunakan untuk melakukan peramalan adalah jaringan syaraf tiruan. Jaringan syaraf tiruan banyak digunakan karena keflesibelan terhadap penyelesaian suatu masalah. Memperhatikan hal tersebut, dikembangkan sebuah model peramalan kebutuhan reseller menggunakan Extreme Learning Machine yang ditujukan untuk prototype Intelligent Warehouse Management System (IWMS) khususnya dalam sub-sistem Intelligent Forecasting System (IFS).",

    deskripsi:
      "To recognize faces in video, face appearances have been widely modeled as piece-wise local linear models which linearly approximate the smooth yet non-linear low dimensional face appearance manifolds. The choice of representations of the local models is crucial. Most of the existing methods learn each local model individually meaning that they only anticipate variations within each class. In this work, we propose to represent local models as Gaussian distributions which are learned simultaneously using the heteroscedastic probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA). Each gallery video is therefore represented as a collection of such distributions. With the PLDA, not only the within-class variations are estimated during the training, the separability between classes is also maximized leading to an improved discrimination. The heteroscedastic PLDA itself is adapted from the standard PLDA to approximate …",

    deskripsi:
      "ace detection is a very important biometric application in the field of image analysis and computer vision. The basic face detection method is AdaBoost algorithm with a cascading Haar-like feature classifiers based on the framework proposed by Viola and Jones. Real-time multiple-face detection, for instance on CCTVs with high resolution, is a computation-intensive procedure. If the procedure is performed sequentially, an optimal real-time performance will not be achieved. In this paper we propose an architectural design for a parallel and multiple-face detection technique based on Viola and Jones' framework. To do this systematically, we look at the problem from 4 points of view, namely: data processing taxonomy, parallel memory architecture, the model of parallel programming, as well as the design of parallel program. We also build a prototype of the proposed parallel technique and conduct a series of experiments to investigate the gained acceleration.",

Thus, the problem is how to choose the best combination of optimization options provided by compiler for a given program or program section. This gives rise the requirement of an orchestration algorithm that fast and effective to search for the best optimization combination for a program.

    deskripsi:
      "Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) adalah transport protocol yang didesain untuk aplikasi Internet multimedia. Protocol ini memiliki beberapa mekanisme congestion control dan dapat dipilih sesuai dengan karakteristik aplikasinya. CCID4 adalah salah satu mekanisme congestion control dari DCCP yang sesuai dengan aplikasi VoIP karena digunakan untuk mengirim paket yang berukuran kecil. Selain itu CCID4 mengatur jarak antar paket minimum sepanjang 10 ms sehingga paket VoIP tidak mendominasi penggunaan jaringan. Penelitian ini melakukan analisis terhadap protokol DCCP/CCID4 untuk mengetahui kualitas VoIP yang menggunakan protokol tersebut, membandingkan kualitas yang dihasilkan dengan penggunaan protokol UDP, serta melihat kualitas aliran TCP sebagai akibat dari terdapatnya aliran VoIP pada jaringan. Hasil simulasi memperlihatkan kualitas VoIP cenderung lebih baik dengan menggunakan protokol UDP dibandingkan dengan DCCP/CCID4 ketika tidak terdapat aliran TCP pada jaringan. Sebaliknya, ketika terdapat aliran TCP maka kualitas VoIP dengan protokol DCCP/CCID4 lebih baik dibandingkan dengan UDP. DCCP/CCID4 berhasil mencegah terjadinya congestion collapse dibandingkan dengan penggunaan UDP. Selain itu, kualitas TCP lebih baik ketika protokol DCCP/CCID4 digunakan untuk aplikasi VoIP pada jaringan yang mengalami congestion.",

Hasil peramalan metode ARIMA-RBF dibandingkan dengan metode ARIMA dan metode RBF secara individual. Hasil analisa menunjukkan bahwa dengan metode penggabungan ARIMA dan RBF, model yang diberikan memiliki hasil yang lebih baik dibandingkan dengan model ARIMA saja atau model RBF saja.

    deskripsi:
      "We address the problem of face recognition on video by employing the recently proposed probabilistic linear discrimi-nant analysis (PLDA). The PLDA has been shown to be robust against pose and expression in image-based face recognition. In this research, the method is extended and applied to video where image set to image set matching is performed. We investigate two approaches of computing similarities between image sets using the PLDA: the closest pair approach and the holistic sets approach. To better model face appearances in video, we also propose the heteroscedastic version of the PLDA which learns the within-class covariance of each individual separately. Our experi-ments on the VidTIMIT and Honda datasets show that the combination of the heteroscedastic PLDA and the closest pair approach achieves the best performance.",

    deskripsi:
      "As the number of nodes in a GPU computing system increases, checkpointing to a global file system becomes more time-consuming due to the I/O bottlenecks and network congestion. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a transparent and scalable checkpoint/restart mechanism for OpenCL applications, named Two-level CheCL. As its name implies, Two-level CheCL consists of two different checkpoint implementations, Local CheCL and Global CheCL. Local CheCL avoids checkpointing to the global file system by utilizing node's local storage. Our experimental results show that Local CheCL can accelerate the checkpointing process by up to four times faster than a conventional checkpointing mechanism. We also implement Global CheCL, which utilizes a global file system, to make sure that we always have a global checkpoint file even in the case of a catastrophic failure. We discuss the performance …",

    deskripsi:
      "Salah satu kemampuan dari sub sistem Intelligent Warehouse Management System (I-WMS) adalah membuat rekomendasi keputusan antar pengambil keputusan. Solusi GDSS ditempuh untuk mengatasi permasalahan jika anggota kelompok pengambil keputusan memiliki sudut pandang yang berbeda, untuk menggabungkan beberapa preferensi dan mendamaikan perbedaan ide. Untuk mencapai tersebut dapat digunakan Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). Pendekatan multi-stage telah banyak dipakai dalam investigasi keputusan, diagnosa medis, efisiensi sistem militer dan lain-lain. Penelitian ini ditujukan untuk melakukan investigasi model Multi-Stage Multi-Multi Attribute Group Decision Making (MS-MAGDM). Kajian MAGDM saat ini cukup maju namun kebanyakan pendekatan hanya berfokus pada argument input yang dikumpulkan pada tahap yang sama. Penelitian ini merupakan kajian baru dalam pembuatan bobot dengan menggunakan TWA (Time-Weighted Averaging) operator untuk memadukan keputusan individu menjadi keputusan kelompok. Selain itu juga menggunakan aturan distribusi untuk menentukan bobot dari kelompok pengambil keputusan ataupun bobot pada setiap stage. Penelitian ini akan memberikan simulasi kasus pemilihan supplier dengan menggunakan beberapa pengambil keputusan. Penelitian ini memberikan kontribusi ilmiah berupa rancangan awal model matematika untuk implementasi MSMAGDM GDSS dalam Enterprise Application, dan membuka kajian-kajian baru dalam metode pengambilan keputusan berbasis Multi-Stage.",

      "Facial expression is one of the main issues of face recognition in uncontrolled environments. In this paper, we apply the probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) method to recognize faces across expressions. Several PLDA approaches are tested and cross-evaluated on the Cohn-Kanade and JAFFE databases. With less samples per gallery subject, high recognition rates comparable to previous works have been achieved indicating the robustness of the approaches. Among the approaches, the mixture of PLDAs has demonstrated better performances. The experimental results also indicate that facial regions around the cheeks, eyes, and eyebrows are more discriminative than regions around the mouth, jaw, chin, and nose.",

    deskripsi:
      "Salah satu metode peramalan yang paling dikembangkan saat ini adalah time series, yakni menggunakan pendekatan kuantitatif dengan data masa lampau yang dijadikan acuan untuk peramalan masa depan. Berbagai penelitian telah mengusulkan metode-metode untuk menyelesaikan time series, di antaranya statistik, jaringan syaraf, wavelet, dan sistem fuzzy. Metode-metode tersebut memiliki kekurangan dan keunggulan yang berbeda. Namun permasalahan yang ada dalam dunia nyata merupakan masalah yang kompleks. Satu metode saja mungkin tidak mampu mengatasi masalah tersebut dengan baik. Dalam artikel ini dibahas penggabungan dua buah metode yaitu Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) dan Radial Basis Function (RBF). Alasan penggabungan kedua metode ini adalah karena adanya asumsi bahwa metode tunggal tidak dapat secara total mengidentifikasi semua karakteristik time series. Pada artikel ini dibahas peramalan terhadap data Indeks Harga Perdagangan Besar (IHPB) dan data inflasi komoditi Indonesia; kedua data berada pada rentang tahun 2006 hingga beberapa bulan di tahun 2012. Kedua data tersebut masing-masing memiliki enam variabel. Hasil peramalan metode ARIMA-RBF dibandingkan dengan metode ARIMA dan metode RBF secara individual. Hasil analisa menunjukkan bahwa dengan metode penggabungan ARIMA dan RBF, model yang diberikan memiliki hasil yang lebih akurat dibandingkan dengan penggunaan salah satu metode saja. Hal ini terlihat dalam visual plot, MAPE, dan RMSE dari semua variabel pada dua data uji coba.",

    deskripsi:
      'Acyclic phase-type distributions are phase-type distributions with triangular matrix representations. They constitute a versatile modelling tool, since they (1) can serve as approximations to any continuous probability distribution, and (2) exhibit special properties and characteristics that usually make their analysis easier. The size of the matrix representations has a strong effect on the computational efforts needed in analyzing these distributions. These representations, however, are not unique, and two representations of the same distribution can differ drastically in size. This thesis proposes an effective algorithm to reduce the size of the matrix representations without altering their associated distributions. The algorithm produces significantly better reductions than existing methods. Furthermore, the algorithm consists in only standard numerical computations, and therefore is straightforward to implement. We identify three operations on acyclic phase-type representations that arise often in stochastic models. Around these operations we develop a simple stochastic process calculus, which provides a framework for stochastic modelling and analysis. We prove that the representations produced by the three operations are "almost surely" minimal, and the reduction algorithm can be used to obtain these almost surely minimal representations. The applicability of these contributions is exhibited on a variety of case studies.',

    deskripsi:
      "Acyclic phase-type distributions are phase-type distributions with triangular matrix representations. They constitute a versatile modelling tool in many circumstances. The size of their matrix representation has a strong influence on computational efforts needed when analyzing these distributions. This representation, however, is not unique, and two representations of the same distribution can differ drastically in size. This paper explores an effective algorithm to reduce the size of the matrix representation without altering the distribution. This proceeds via a symbolic representation of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the phase-type distribution. The algorithm is of cubic complexity in the size of the given representation. We clarify the circumstances under which the algorithm returns a minimal representation, and discuss in how far it can keep representations minimal when they are constructed via any of three operations …",

    judul: "Compositional dependability evaluation for STATEMATE",
    deskripsi:
      'Software and system dependability is getting ever more important in embedded system design. Current industrial practice of model-based analysis is supported by state-transition diagrammatic notations such as Statecharts. State-of-the-art modelling tools like Statemate support safety and failure-effect analysis at design time, but restricted to qualitative properties. This paper reports on a (plug-in) extension of Statemate enabling the evaluation of quantitative dependability properties at design time. The extension is compositional in the way the model is augmented with probabilistic timing information. This fact is exploited in the construction of the underlying mathematical model, a uniform continuous-time Markov decision process, on which we are able to check requirements of the form: "The probability to hit a safety-critical system configuration within a mission time of 3 hours is at most 0.01." We give a detailed …',

    deskripsi:
      "Analysis of models comprising concurrent stochastic processes leads to state space explosion, just like in many other areas of formal validation. The number of states grows exponentially in the number of involved processes. One of the principal constituents of many such processes is the so-called Erlang distribution, which is particularly well-suited as approximations for fixed delays - with adjustable accuracy. The concurrent execution of Erlang distributions corresponds to their maximum. In this paper, we show that an exponential growth of the Markov chain representation of the maximum of Erlang distributions is inevitable. This is because even its minimal representations grow exponentially.",

    deskripsi:
      "Wireless embedded sensor networks are predicted to provide attractive application possibilities in industry as well as at home. IEEE 802.15.4 and ZigBee are proposed as standards for such networks with a particular focus on pairing reliability with energy efficiency, while sacrificing high data rates. IEEE 802.15.4 is configurable in many aspects, including the synchronicity of the communication, and the periodicity in which battery-powered sensors need to wake up to communicate. This paper develops a formal behavioral model for the energy implications of these options. The model is modularly specified using the language modest , which has an operational semantics mapping on stochastic timed automata. The latter are simulated using a variant of discrete-event simulation implemented in the tool Möbius .

    deskripsi:
      "A Markov Reward Model (MRM) is a Stochastic Process satisfying the Markov property. MRMs have been used for the simultaneous analysis of performance and dependability issues of computer systems, sometimes referred to as performability. Previous work for Model Checking MRMs [Bai00, Bai02, Hav02] is restricted to state-based reward rates only. However, greater insight into the operation of systems can be obtained when impulse rewards are incorporated in these models which express the instantaneous cost imposed with the change of state of systems. The main aim of this thesis is to enable Model Checking of MRMs with impulse rewards. In this thesis methods for Model Checking MRMs have been extended for the incorporation of impulse rewards. To that end, the syntax and semantics of the temporal logic CSRL (Continuous Stochastic Reward Logic) have been adapted and algorithms have been developed and implemented that allow for the automated verification of properties expressed in that logic. iii",

Efisiensi Algoritma dapat dilihat dengan beberapa cara yang salah satunya adalah dengan cara empiris. Algoritma titik interior yang dikenalkan pertama kali oleh Karmakar merupakan salah satu algoritma yang mempunyai waktu kompleksitas polinomial. Pada penelitian ini dikupas mengenai algoritma tersebut secara empiris yaitu dengan menjalankan berbagai ukuran permasalahan dan dicatat datanya. Hal-hal yang dilihat dari algoritma ini adalah pengaruh presolving dan kompleksitas algoritma. Hasil yang diperoleh adalah bahwa pertama: presolving dapat mengurangi ukuran permasalahan, waktu penyelesaian algoritma, dan waktu total penyelesaian. Hal lain yang dilihat adalah waktu untuk presolving lebih besar dari pada satu iterasi algoritma. Kedua: kecenderungan jumlah iterasi dan waktu kompleksitas algoritma titik interior terhadap ukuran permasalahan secara empiris berupa fungsi power yaitu O (n0. 2294) untuk jumlah iterasi dan.

    deskripsi:
      "This research aims to overcome general challenges in the field of image pattern recognition using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is still faced with the complexity and limitations of image data. Achieving high accuracy is essential because it significantly influences the effectiveness and success of numerous areas. Although deep learning technology, especially CNNs, offers the potential to improve accuracy, it is still limited to the 70–80% range for achieving the expected level of accuracy. In this research, a fusion method was developed that combines pre-trained models using concatenation techniques to increase accuracy. By utilizing pre-trained models such as ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNet-v2, which were then adapted to various datasets and cross-validation techniques, researchers managed to achieve significant improvements in accuracy. The results of this study show an improvement in the accuracy of the Fusion Multi-CNN model for various datasets. On the fashion dataset, MNIST managed to achieve an accuracy of 0.87840, while on CIFAR-10 and Oxford-102, the accuracy was 0.81260 and 0.84004, respectively.",

    deskripsi:
      "Children's nutritional requirements differ from those of adults. The health ministry's Indonesian data shows that in 2017, there were 17.8% of malnourished children under five years old (toddlers), one of which was related to complementary breastfeeding problems. Complementary breastfeeding is given to babies starting at 6–24 months of age. This research aims to build a complementary breastfeeding search model and be able to present it as a treatment for malnourished babies. A search model is built to understand natural language input given by a user. Also, it can do reasoning by applying a set of rules to obtain implicit knowledge about the complementary breastfeeding menu recommended for babies. The methods used in this research are data collection, designing a search model, building an ontology model, building SWRL, natural language processing, and usability testing by users and nutritionists. This research succeeded in building an ontology-based complementary breastfeeding search model in the form of a semantic web. The testing result shows that the web can provide an alternative complementary breastfeeding menu according to the baby’s nutritional needs and has a high usability capability of 4.01 on a scale of 1 to 5.",

      "Personality Classification of Myers Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI) Using BERT and Machine Learning",
    deskripsi:
      "Personality classification using textual data from social media or online forums is a complex task due to the unstructured text and the multifaceted nature of personality. While the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) provides a comprehensive framework, adapting it to media data and handling diverse linguistic patterns requires effective algorithms. The psychological basis of MBTI is intricate, especially when using complex methods like deep learning, which can be challenging.",

      "Progressive Content Generation Based on Cyclic Graph for Generate Dungeon",
    deskripsi:
      "Dungeon is level in game consisting collection of rooms and doors with obstacles inside. To make good level, takes a lot of time. With Procedural Content Generation (PCG), dungeons can be created automatically. One of the approaches in PCG to create levels is progressive. Progressive approach produces timeline as representation of the interactions in the game. Timeline representation that is in the form of one straight line is good for endless runner, but for dungeon, the levels are linear. In this research, the timeline is changed to cyclic graph. Cyclic graph is formed using graph grammar algorithm. This research aims to build dungeon that has not linear and minimal dead ends. To eliminate linearity in dungeons, branching in dungeons needs to be formed. The steps carried out in this research are designing graph grammar rules, generating population of graphs, evaluating graphs with fitness values, and building dungeons. Four functions are used to determine the fitness value: shortest vertices, average duration, replayability, and variation. Dungeons produced with progressive approach manage to minimize linearity in dungeons. Dungeon formation is very dependent on the rule grammar that forms it. With the evaluation process, linear dungeons resulting from grammar rules can be minimized.",

    deskripsi:
      "Traditional Indonesian music is an Indonesian cultural heritage that is often forgotten by modern society. Many people do not know which area the traditional music came from. This is a problem because of the large amount of traditional music that loses its identity. Deep Learning technology can be a solution to this traditional music classification problem. The topic of traditional music classification was chosen because there has been no research using this topic before.",

      "Two-Step Iris Recognition Verification Using 2D Gabor Wavelet and Domain-Specific Binarized Statistical Image Features",
    deskripsi:
      "The Iris is one of the most reliable biometric features due to its complex textural properties. However, using coloured contact lenses renders the iris unreliable in iris recognition systems. Colored contact lenses are one of the spoofing methods in biometrics that can conceal a person's identity. To prevent spoofing, a two-step verification process is needed in the iris recognition system. The first verification step is to detect colored contact lenses, while the second is to recognize or match a person's identity. The feature extraction methods used are Domain Specific Binarized Statistical Image Features (DSBSIF) and Gabor Wavelet. The method for detecting contact lenses is Support Vector Machine (SVM), and matching is performed using Hamming Distance (HD). This study conducted experiments using single features, feature fusion, and hybrid feature extraction methods combining DSBSIF and Gabor Wavelet for two-step iris recognition verification. The results indicate that the hybrid feature extraction method of DSBSIF and Gabor Wavelet achieved the highest accuracy of 99.95% for the first verification and 95.40% for the second verification. These results are 0.02 and 0.31 percentage points better, respectively than previous methods in the first and second verifications.",
